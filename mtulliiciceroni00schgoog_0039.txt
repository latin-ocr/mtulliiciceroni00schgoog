nature 01 the gods. The doctrine 01 310010, 30 being the original
elements 01 311 things, is silly and untenable3 but even granting it
to be true, and so supposing the gods to have arisen 11010 310100,
their immortality would be in contradiction with it (65-68). But
in order to be able to maintain this immortality Epicurus takes his
usual course wh'en he wishes to escape the consequences 01 his own
principles 3 he flies to other arbitraryand inconceivable propositions.
The gods, says he, are not corporea, hut only quasi corporeal
beings.¹ But this quasi corporealily is a word devoid 01 00000, con·
veying 00 idea even to Epicurus and his disciples (69-75). But let
this pass, 11 we will, the case is no better 101 1110 assertiou that the
gods have human forms. The reasons given by the Epicureans in
support 01 this are next refuted one after another3 and especially
the assertion, that no person can imagine the gods under any other
form, is rejected as practically false, since many represent them
under the figures 01 beasts (76-82). But it is quite unworthy 01 3
philosopher to appeal to representations 01 that sort. A person
might with equal justice also maintain that the gods really bear the
names that are traditionally used to denote them3 and the toolish·
ness 01 11110 10 directly apparent, when we observe that the same
gods are differently called among different nations.2

If now we may not attribute to the gods either the human form,
as we have proved, nor in deferente to Epicurus any other form, it
would not be venturing 100 much to deny their existence entirely,
yet the Epicureans do not venture this 101 1031 001 only 01 0100 but
also 01 the gods themselves (83-86). But if the assertion is made
that reason can exist only in union with the human form, because
we have no experience 01 itin any other shape, we may answer that it
is quite unphilosophical to maintain that a thing 01 which we have
no experience may not 101 311 that have existence (87, 88).

1 When Cotta states that Epicurus assumes this finer bodily substance, the
quasi corpus 01 1110 gods, only 101 1110 purpose 01 explaining their immortality,
it is certainly either misunderstanding or intentional misrepresentation. The
immortality could only be explained according to Epicurus by the law 01
isonomy; at the same time he might add that the finer corporeal substance 01
1110 gods was in itself less liable to dissolution and corruption than the coarser
bodies 01 011101 things. - For another misrepresentation‚ that Epicurus explained
the immortality from the infinite multitude 01 310100, 000 0010 10 c. 39, 109.
