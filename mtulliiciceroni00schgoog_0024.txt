INTRODUCFION. l 1

Zeus,¹ and partly because these gods according to the Stoic explana·
tions were no persons, but things, relations, capacities‚ &c.‘²; hence
the Stoics have been attached as being atheists. But these two
reproaches are easily seen to neutralize each other3 for is these gods
were for the Stoics only things, relations and capacitieS, and if they
were only called gods by way of personification, the Stoics could
not be blamed for considering them morta13 they could not of course
exist longer than the world. The other reproach could only reason-
ably be made by those persons who acquitted the Stoics of the
second (namely that the gods were only to be held as such bya
figure of speech), while they recognized their belief in the person-
ality of the gods. And in reality it is difficult to see why the Stoics‚
if not all, at least some or perhaps many of them might not have
held that belief. The consistency of the system certainly in no wise
forbade their acknowledging the existence oi superhuman beings
who, as servants and helpers of the supreme god, presided over the
world and human life in various spheres and relations; and thus
they could always without hesitation assent to the popular saith
which offered them such deities. lt was a contradiction with the
popular faith that they conceived them to be mortal, but not one
worthy of blame. The popular saith was not shoclred at the idea ol
gods that had had abeginning3 and if in spite os this it held such
gods as immortal, the Stoics were on the other hand more consis-
tent3 and the whole reproach, carefully examined‚ amounts to no
more than this, that, since immortality is necessarily included in the
idea of the deity, their godS, as not being immortal, were really no
godS, but only superhuman‚ demonic beings: but on the other
hand as a compensation for this they conceived the one supreme
God of a majesty truly divine.

A third reproach, which is osten made against the Stoics, is that
they degraded the gods by teaching that man owed to thern only
inferior endowments and external goods, while he could attain to
wisdom and virtue by himself alone.³ This reproach too has no
sense except we concede that the gods were for the Stoics real
