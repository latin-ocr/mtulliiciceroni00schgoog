Boos< 1.-c1n1›. κς 5· 185

he has just ascribed to Thales, but only to the intimate union of mind
and matter in the same elementary substance; so that in the statement
of that view we must suppose an incorrectness of expression, perhaps
through the fault of Cicero, which has obscured its real purport.-
[The reading of this passage here given has become a sort of textus
receptus, and we have not ventured to give any other; but it is tar
from satisfactory. we have to deal of course not with what Thales
’ really taught, but with what Cicero thought he taught ; and the answer
is such as Cicero supposed an Epicurean would have made. In line 11
Cicero says that Thales taught that aqeeam esse initium rerum, and
that deum eom mentem esse, which created all things out of water. He
must have thought then that deum and arentem were identical, denoting
the creating power as distinguished from aqua, the matter. Now the
Epicurean’s objections to almost all the views commented upon in the
following summary is simply that we cannot conceive os God or mind
without sensation, or without a body for this purpose: ct'. l. 20, quasi aut
a'e'r sine ullo formo deus esse possit &c.; l. 31, aperto simplexque mens,
nullo re adiuncta, qua sentire possit, fugere intellegentiae nostroe vim et
notionem videtum· 41, 33, air . . ‚ quem sensum habere potest out quam
formam dei? So in 42, 2, in the criticisrn on Plato ; irr 42, 29, on Aris·
totle; in 43, 14 ς in 43, 20. In the passage in question the objection is
made that God or mind must have a body and hence sensation3 and it
it could be otherwise, Thales had no need os associating god or mind with
water, he might have left it a separate existence. We understand then
the two suppositions Si di possunt esse sine sensu, and si ipsa mens con·
stare potest vacans corporeas the same in substance ; and the conclusion
to be drawn in the form of the question,-mentem eur aquae adiunxit?
Heindorf proposed si dii possunt esse sine sensu eur oquae mentem oral-
iunxit‚ si ipso oriens dcc. Prof. Schoemann (Opusc. Ac. ΙΙΙ, p. 285) says
of this “Hoc refutari ieiltil opus est,'’ and emends the passage as it stands
in our text. But assuming as he does that the two suppositions are dif-
ferent in substance, there should be two conclusions also differing in sub·
stance. What difference is there between associating mind with water, or
water with mind? The logical trairr of thought under Schoemann's sup·
position would be: Si di possunt dcc, deum (not mentem) cur aquae
adiunxit ,⁴ si mens constare dec, ruentem cur aquae adiieuxit. It is of
course not possible to say what Cicero really wrote 3 hut we should prefer
to read: Si di possunt esse sine sensu, mentem cur aquae adiunxit, si
ipsa niens dvc. The edd. and Ms.O have sensu et niente cur aquae ad·
iunxit,¹ arrd B¹ (Orelli) has mentem sor mente. A. Weidner (Philologus,
Vol.38, 1879) emends thusr Sed nec di possunt esse sinte sensu, et men·
tem curaquae adiunxit &c].
