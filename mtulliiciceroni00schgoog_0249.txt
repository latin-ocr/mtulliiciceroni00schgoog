82. 20. [Primam posuit eum &e One isalmost tempted to refer eam
and alteram to notiones, considering the expressions eam, quae orta esset,
and alteram, quam ceperimus ,· but farther on we find tertiam, quae terre·
ret, and Quartam causam esse dcc, which show that the antecedent is
causis. The passage is carelessly written]

14 82. 28. praeter naturam . . . portentis3 ahyphen, as above c. 2,5.

82. 30. nuper bello Octaviano. mue. 6⁶7. ΤΙιε consul Cn. Octa·
vius, a partisan of Sulla, was besieged and slain by his colleague L. Cor·
nelius Cinna and Marius who had just returned from Africa, while Sulla
was fighting against Mithridates. Bellum Octavianum also in De Div. I,
n, 4 ; Philipp. XIV, 8, 23; Florus 111, 21, 9. The adverb nuper might
seem to indicate that we must imagine the present conversation to have
taken place but a short time after that war. But the meaning of nuperis
very relative, and it is hence used of somewhat remote periods of time, as
in De Div. l, 39, 85: ante philosophiam patefactam quae nuper inuenta
est,· and c. 50, 126 we even find: quae nuper, id est paucis aute saeculis,
reperta strnl,· where the period of modern culture is opposed to the early
dark and uncultivated ages.

82. 32. Tuditano (C. Sempronio) et (Μ’.) Aquilio coss. n.1J.c.625.
On the death of Scipio Africanus see 111, 32, 80 and note. The double sun
in that year is also referred to in De Repub. Ι, 10, i 5.

15 83. 4. non esse ea fontalia for eas pulsatas. Comp. above c. 3,7;
and below 7, 18 extra also 34, 873 and 35, 883 De Leg. II, ri, 28: Beue
vero qzcorl roseus, pietas, oirlvcs, fides consecratur. . . ut, illa qui habeant
. . ., deos ipsos iu animis suis collocatos putent. The use of the neuter here
is not strange because the objects to which the pronoun refers have only a
grammatical, not a natural, gender.

83. 10. nihil . . .vetusias mentita sit, ee. the endless lapse of time
has never deceived men's expectati011s; the phenonrena have always hap·
pened just as they ought and were expected to do according to the laws
observed by men. Comp. c. 21, 56. Τίς γένοιτ’ dv ripabrlera τοιάδε; is the
question ashed in a similar connection in the treatise De Mundo, c. 5,
falsely ascribed to Aristotle, but the work of some later Peripatetic.
