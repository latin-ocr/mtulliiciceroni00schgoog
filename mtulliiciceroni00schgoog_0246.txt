Boon 11.-cnn›. 111, §s Η, 233

80. 33. C. Flaminius (Nepos), “contra auspicia profectus, signis mili-
taribus effossis, quae tolli non potuerant, et ab equo, quem conscenderat,
per caput devolutus„ . .ab Hannibale ad Trasimenum lacum caesus est.''
Epitom. Liv. lib. xxm-The person whom Cicero calls Caelius is C.
Caelius Antipater, an annalist ol the first hals of the seventh century, who
had written the history oi the second Punic war.

81. 3. religione . . . multo superiores. Sall. Cat. c. 12: nostri
maiores religiosissimi mortales. Comp. Preller, Rom. Myth.‚ p. 1133
Boissier, litudes sur Varron‚ p. 297.

81. 4. Atti Navli. Comp. Livy Ι, 36, where he is called inclitus ea a
tempestate augur, ie. in the time of Tarquinius Priscus. It is an error of
memory that Cicero mentions Hostilius here ; in other passages, De Repub.
ΙΙ, 20, 36 and De Div. Ι, 17, 31 where the same story is told in more de-
tail, he gives it correctly.

81. 10. peremnia, auspices taken at the crossing oia river.

81.11. ex acuminibus, “auspicium totum militarc’' says Cicero
De Div. ΙΙ, 36, 77. But it is impossible to ascertain wuith certainty what is
to be understood by acumina, whether the points of lances on which elec-
tric flames were sometimes seen, or the tongned flames os the sacrificial lire,
or the points of the beaks of the birds, or what not. See the citations in
Giese and Moser, Cic. De Div, p. 293·

81. 11. nulla, eum viri vocantur. The nulli oiri vocantur of
the MSS, which no one has ever been able to explain (comp. Schoem.
Opusc. Ac. ΙΙΙ, p. 275), must necessarily be thus amended. Gellius XV,
27, 3 expresses the idea more sully: eum viri ad praelium faciendum in
aciem uocabantur. While the army was forming in line of battle the gen·
eral took the auspices: is apud quem in exercitu auspicium imperiumque
erat, iu tabernaculo in sella sedens auspicabatur. Sabidius in Schol.
Veron. on Virg. Aen. X, 241. When the soldiers were arranged in battle
array, in procinctu, they occupied the time while the general was taking
the auspices in making their wills before three or four of their companions=
interim ca mora utebantur qui testamenta in procinctu facere volebant,
says Sabidius in loco. A will made under such circumstances without
further formalities (sine libra atque tabrelis, De Orat. I, 53, 228) was
legally valid. When the taking of the auspices fell into disuse the testa·
menta in procinctu also ceased, as there was no time for making thern.
'lhis incidental remark may be here superfluous; but it need not for that
reason have been regarded by the critics as suspicions. lt is to he considered
in the same way as the similar remarks ΙΙ, 36, 9ι; 43, 111 ; ΙΙΙ, 10, 25.
The opinion oi some that the testamenta in procinctu had not fallen into
disuse in Cicero’s time is without foundation.
