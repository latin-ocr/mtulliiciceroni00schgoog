veiim ascribing however the highest intellectual and moral perfection not
to this νοῦς, but to a later stage of development. Nothing more is known
of his views, and we cannot be certain whether qua onznia regantur is
really said here in the same sense as he intended it.

42. 20. intortio de philosophia libro. This work is no longer 33
extant. lt was one of the popular works written in the form osa dia-
logue. See Bernays, Die Dialoge des Arist, pp. 95 and 99.

42. 22. mentI, i.e. the highest intelligence, the pure, incorporeal spirit,
νοῦς. Metaph. XII, 6. 7. 9.

42. 23. mundum ipsum deum esse. Aristotle nowhere asserts that
the universe is God: but he calls the heavens ἀθάνατόν τι καὶ θεῖον, De
Caelo ΙΙ, 1, 3.

42. 23. alium quendam. He means probably what Aristotle in
Meteor. Ι, 3 and De Caelo II,4 calls πρῶτον στοιχεῖον, πρῶτον τῶν σωμά-
των, an οὐσία σώματος άλλη παρὰ τὰς ἐνταῦθα (ie. ἐν τῇ γῇ) συστάσεις θειο·
τέρα καὶ προτέρα (De Caelo Ι, 2), the quinta natura mentioned above
(note to c. 8, 19), which occupies the space above the moon, and from
which are formed the heavenly bodies and their spheres. This nobler,
godlike elementis endowed with a circular motion, which explains the revo-
lution of the heavens and the heavenly bodies; and it is this motion which
is here designated by replicatio,a motion returning upon itself. Comp.
Stob. Ecl. Phys. I, p. 64 and especially Plut. Plac. Phil. Ι, 7.

42. 25. caeli ardorem. Only another name lor the substance just
spoken of, which Aristotle himself (De Caelo I, 3) explains to be what
others call aether. On this expression see note to c. 8, 18.

42. 28. IIIi tot (11. By this expression it is impossible to understand .
the three just mentioned, the mundus, the governor of the mundus, and
the cabli ardor. Therefore some passage must have been lost in which
heavenly bodies were probably spoken of ; and those, being formed of a
divine matter, might themselves be called divine (θεῖα, δαιμόνια). Comp.
Stob. Ecl. Phys. Ι, p. 486, where they are also called θεοί.

42. 32. semper se movens. According to Aristotle the supreme
God is himself without motion, but is himself the cause of the motion of
the universe. The Epicurean could not quite understand anything that
caused motion, being itself immovable ; hence he says se nrovens.

42. 33. Xenocrates of Chalcedon, disciple ol Plato (hence condis· at
cipulus of Aristotle), and successor of Speusippus as teacher in the Acad-
emy after ac. 339.

42. 35. deos enim octo esse diere. The account of the theology of
Xenocrates is very incomplete; it is more fully given in Stob. Ecl. Ι,
p. 62. At the head he placed the μονάς and the δυάς, the unity and the
