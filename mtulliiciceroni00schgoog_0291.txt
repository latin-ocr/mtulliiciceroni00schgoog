nrutuo for [multum] and remarksz] instead of mutuo perhaps multum
should be read; the Mss. have multum. [Kayserz motu lunae, apud
Baiter ΙΙ.]

121. 29· montes vestiti atque silvestres; the second expression to
detine more nearly the first. Comp. c. 64, 161: vestitusque densissimos
montium.

121. 31. [For utilitates, a conjecture of H. A. Koch, Schoemann
reads doten] -dotes denique innumerabiles, “in short, gifts without
number '’ with which the earth is provided, and which serve mankind partly
for nourishment and partly for other necessities of life (ad victum etad
vitam). Denique is regularly used to close with a general and compre·
hensive term an enuineration of several particulata—artes, which is the
reading of the Mss. for dotes, is an error in copying which often occurs3
see Schoem. Opusc. Ac. ΙΙΙ, 340; had Cicero mentioned the at·tslre1e,he
would have erred in putting together things which should remain distinct.
For the arts are invented by man, this capacity oi invention is all that
nature has given him ; they should therefore not be thrown together with
the salutary and nseful phenomena and products oi nature, which by their
dotes, the properties with which nature has endowed them, are useful and
valuable to men. Moreover the arts are afterwards mentioned in their
proper place, c. 59, 148. Dotes is preciseiy the word for the sense required
here. [Dotes is a conjecture of Schoemann.]

153} 122. 15- os . ..spiritu augetur, “the mouth is gifted with breat ”;
for augeri aliqua re is never used except of things which are to one’s
advantage, useful or agreeable. But the old physiologists themselves
would hardly have aclrnowledged that the breath was especially of advan-
tage to the mouth ; rather as Cicero himself says, c. 55, 136, the breath is
the cibus animalis, quo maxime aluntur animantes.

122. 17. [For [abiis] Schoemann writes ab lais without brackets and
gives this note z] manditur abhis. ab ltis might have been left out here,
but still it is defensible. See Opusc. Ac. III, p. 372.

122. 18. adversi <lentes are the front teeth, as adversum corpus the
front of the body.

“ 135 122. 21. stomachus, the oesophagus; not the stomach proper, but the
way to it. Celsus IV, 1: deinde duo intinere incipiunt: alterum ospe·
rom arteriam nominant, alterum stomachum ,¹ arteria exterior aa' pul·
monem, stomachus interior ad ventriculum fertur.

122. 22. tosillas, tonsils‚ the glande at the back of the mouth at the
commencement of the oesophagus. Colles saucium spectantes uvam (the
uoula), lact. De Opif. Dei, c. 11, 9.
