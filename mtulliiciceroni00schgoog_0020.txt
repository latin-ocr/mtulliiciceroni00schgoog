based upon it. The circumstance that he is spoken of as an atheist

must not be taken for a proof that he entirely denied the existence
of adeity; for that term was not unfrequently applied to such as
only declared their disbelief in the gods of the people. Euhemerus
had many followers. Among them were the theologi, mentioned by
Cicero, ΙΙΙ, 21, 53; from the same passage we learn that, in conse·
quence of the many and contradictory fables that were current about
each of the gods, it had been found necessary to distinguish several
persons of the same name, in order to remove the contradictions.
F or this reason Johannes the Lydian (DcMensibus IV, 48) calls
this view the heroic and separanti view, τὸν ἡρωικὸν καὶ μεριστικὸν
λόγον; the first, because it explained the gods to be heroes of the
olden time, the second, because it distinguished the fables in the
manner just alluded to.

Other philosophers, antagonists of the popular belief, directed ι
their arguments not against the existence of gods of all sortS, but
only of such gods as the people imagined. To this class belong
especially Democritus and Epicurus, who conceded the truth of the ⁸
popular faith only to a limited extent, they held that a belief so
universally diffused and so fast-rooted in the minds of men must be
more than a mere illusion, that some reality must lie at the founda-
tion of it. But further than this they did not g03 they allowed no
voice to the common belief in regard to the nature of the gods, to their
power and influence over the world and mankind, on these points
they claimed that speculation alone had a right to be heard. Accord-
ingly Democritus explained thc gods to be atomic shapeS, emana· Ι
tions from a universal divine substance, evidently very different '¹
beings from the popular deities; yet not without influence, sorne-
times benevolent‚ sometimes hostile, upon the lives of mcn.¹ But
Epicurus went further. His gods, atomic shapes like those of De·
mocritus, lived in happy idleness, without the slightest influence
upon the world, with no evident relations to human 1ife; and when
he spoke of a religious reverence due to the gods in view of their
happiness and their majesty, he evidently did so with no real con-
viction3 although it would be too much to say that he did not
believe the existence of any gods, and only pretended to do so ¹¹
