from Locri. The battle, which ended iu the total defeat of the people of
Croto, took place about ne. 580. See Heyne, Opusc. Ac. ΙΙ, p. 185; aud
on the participatior os the Dioskuri see Klausen‚ AEneas u. d. Penaten,
p. 666; and lheller, Rdm. Myth., p. 659.

80. 16. Faunorum, field and wood gods of a lower order, to whom
were ascribed all sorts of spectral apparitione and eries. Originally the
popular belief knew only one Faunus, who was said to have been king in
old times in Latium; at a later period there were many. Comp. De. Div.
1, 45, 101 ; and below 111, 6, 15.

80. 19. ea ossendl, foreas. Comp. note on c. 5, 15. The Mss. add
quae sint or petae stent or quaeseeturn siud: evidently additions of persons
who were disturbed by the neuter of the pronoun. For leoneinibus, which
is plainly nnnecessary‚ perhaps diuinitus would be better. -ΤΙιε following
series of synonymous expressions is also found De Div. I, 42, 93. lt is dif-
ficult to distinguish the ideas clearly; but it may be said with Doederlein
(Synon. Part 5, p. 174), that prodigium expresses more particularly whatis
significant and leads to important consequences; ostentum what is wonder·
ful and extraordinary; portentum what is terrible and threatening; and

- monstrum what is unnatural and ugly.-The pronoun illa has no gram·

matical relation to the preceding ea,· it is rather to be explained illu qnae
nobis res suturas ostendunt dcc.

80. 20. [This phrase illa ostentu &c is cited by Nttgelsbach Latein.
Stylistilr, ξ 3, 2, b, asa case where the want of an article in Latin is sup·
plied by the demonstrative pronoun, equivalent here to Greek τά. ostenta
dre. are then subjects of dicuntur. Comp. Tusc. V, 27, 78: Mulieres...
iu certamen . . . verrerint. . .,· quaeest victa, ea laeta prosequentibus suis
utta cnon viro iu rogum imponitur, illa victa ntaesta discedit. But it
seems preferable to take illa as referring to praedictiones et praesensiones
with a change of gcnder like that of ea]

80. 21. quodsi ea fictu credimus. We should expect quae de Mopso
dc.. tradantur to follow; instead of that Cicero with a freer turn of expres·
sion uses only the names—They are all names of famous seers of the
heroic age. ’

80. 24. sl res . . .repudiar·et. Comp. Verr. ΙΙ, 55, 138: ut, etiamsi
hoenines tacerent, res tanren ipsa illum censum repudiaret.

80. 25. P. Claudii (Pulchri) temeritas. The occurrence took
place nuc. 505 ; the battle was near Drepanum against the Punic general
Adherbal.

80. 30. lunius (L. Pullus). ΤΙιο disaster happened near the pro·
montory Pachynum: his mistalre uvas qnod aa'tio enavigasset (Cic. De Div. Ῑ,
16, 29), i.e. contra auspicia, or avibus non addicentibus.
