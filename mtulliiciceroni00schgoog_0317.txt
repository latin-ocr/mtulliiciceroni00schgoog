Aelian. V. H. V, 14 and others state thatin ancient times it was considered
wrong to lrill an ox in Italy and Greece, aud it was forbidden under severe
punishment. Pliny H. N. VIII, 45, p. 556 narrates that at Rome a man
was once punished with exile for this crime. The ox was only rarely offered
iu sacrifice to the gods, under particular circumstances. See Hermann
Gottesd. Alterth. § 26, 20 or Schoemann Griech. Alterth.11³, p. 245.

detail.

says:] We gain srom them medicinal remedies by investigation and
labor, as above c. so, 151: e terrae cavernis serrum elicimus [for eligi·
