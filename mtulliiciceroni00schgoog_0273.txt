260 NOTES.

urium egregii mortalem altique silenti ,¹ Epod. 111142 sagacius unm
odoror. In the text the Mss. carelessly have unum before convenit, where
it gives no adequate sense.

ξιξ) 102. 2. constitutas, “set in order ’'; ior the Stoic did not, any more
than other ancient philosophers‚ believe in an actual creation of the world
by the gods, that is, a creation out of nothing. Comp. note c. 35, 88. lu
the passage further on: ab animantibus principiis ea esse generata, it is
only intended to say, that the existing divine sactors in the creation oi the
world, themselves issued from the elemental ether, the >ayn σπερματικοί
(Plut. De Plac. Phil. 1, 7, 173 Diog. L. VII, 148), or the δυνάμεις γόνιμοι
(as Μ. Aurel. IX, 1 extr. calls them) which are spirit and matter in one,
have caused later created things to issue from themselves. It must how·
ever he consessed that this proposition does not really belong here, where
the discourse was to be, notos the origin ol things, but of the government
of the world.

102. 8. ea esse generata. The Mss. have eam . . generatam, which
would refer to sentiens natura. But by this last expression we can only
understand, as the subsequent explanation ἓξ 81-86 shows, the soul of the
universe, ie. the portion oi the original deity entering into the universe
(sce Introd, p. 8), which first manifests itseli in the λόγοις σπερματικοῑς,
Cicero's animantibus principiis, but is by no means created by them.

to 102.12. simulacra . ..imagines The change os expression does
not denote a difference in the vicws of these philosophers‚ but the two
words are synonyms employed for the sake oi variety. Comp. I, 12, 29
where the gods of Democritus are also called imagines ,· and Ι, 26, 74.
lt is quite true however that the inusta of Democritus differ from those os
Epicurus in this, that the latter proceed from the divine beings existing in
the inlermzmdia ,· the former arise from the atoms flowing sorth srom the
formless divine substance (see note on I,43,120),which take various forms
by their own agency. Comp Papencordt De Atomic. Doctr. (Berolin.
1832), p. 70; and Schoemann’s essay De Epicuri Theolog. iu his Opusc.
Ac. 1V,p. sss· .

102.12. quodam paeto negat. This is true inagreater degree os
Epicurus, whose so-called gods were hardly worthy the name, than os
Democritus, whose gods were not entirely without influence on the affairs
os men. See above I, 43, 120.

102. 18. vl magna incitata. A necessity assumed to be arr'ginal,
and yet set in action by any other sorec, would be a contradiction. vi
aragne thenis not to bc translated ‘⁴ by a powerlul so1·ce,” but “ witi pow-
erlul sorce,’¹ [abl. triadi] 3 and rasitata isto bc taken in a mediol, not a
passive sense [“ acting powersully ’'].
