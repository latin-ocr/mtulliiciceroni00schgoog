45. 19. Aegyptiorumque . . .dementlam. Velleius refers to the
worship of the sacred animals and oi the gods appearing under the form
ol aninrals. See c. 29, 81; 36, ror; III, 19, 47.

45. 22. venerari Epicurum. This is characteristic. The followers
oi Epicurus frequently used such exaggerated expressions os reverencc
towards their master and were ridiculed for it by their antagonists. Comp.
Plut. contra Colot. c. 17.

45. 26. anticipationem ...πρόληψιν Epicurus designated by this
term the universal ideas acquired from recollection of repeated perceptions
and comparison of the impressions made thereby, inasmuch as they precede
and form the basis of every jndgment of true and false andos all further
operations of the mind; this is indicated by the following words sine
qua . . . potest. Comp. Sext. Empir. adv. Math. Ι, 57: orire ζητεῖν orire
ἀπορεῖν ἐστι κατὰ τὸν σοφὸν Ἐπίκουρον ἄνευ προλήψεως. [Diog. L. X, 33:
τὴν δὲ πρόληψιν λέγουσιν οἱονεὶ κατάληψιν ἢ δόξαν ὀρθὴν ἢ ἔννοιαν ἣ radob-
νῆν νόησιν ἐναποκειμένην, τουτέστι μνήμην τοῦ πολλάκις ἔξωθεν φανέντος]

45. 30. dc regula et indicto, according to Diog. L. X, ²7 περὶ κρι-
τηρό.··,ὴ κανών, ἑν. on the test oi truth or the rule i.e. oi judgment. ln
this book Epicurus set forth his system of Logic. [See note on 1, 5, ta]

1447 45. 32. [Cum enim non... The negative belongs to the first clause,
oi which sil constituta is the verb, and ior que after mama! we should
use in English an adversative conjunction, but. ad unum, “without
exception.’']

45. 35. innatas cognitiones· Cicero must have lrnown that Epicurus
did not hold the πρόληψις to be innare, but to arise alter the manner men·
tioned above; hence Diog. L. X, 33 calls it μνήμη τοῦ πολλάκις φανέντος.
ln using the word innatas therefore he merely indicates the natural
origin in the mind, the in anirno natum, which was not clearly expressed
by insitas. Comp. note to ΙΙ, 4, 12; 17, 45. [De Fin. 1, 9, 31: Itaque
aiunt hanc quusi naturalem atque insitam in animis nostris inesse
notionem irc]

46. 1. ld verum neccsse cst. Comp. ΙΙ, 2, 5; and 4, ιν, per con·
tra Ι, 23, 62.

46. 4. [hanc nos habere anticipationem, namely ut deos beatos dre.
which comes aiter the following parenthesis]

46. 7. qnam antea nemo. The StoicS, the first os whom Zeno was
contemporary of Epicurus, used the word in a similar significatiom ir
