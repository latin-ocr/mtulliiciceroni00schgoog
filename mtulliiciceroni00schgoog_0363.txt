334 DE NATURA DEORUM.

notes the similarity of the nature of the impressions to that of the mind of
man, since both 'consist of the most minute atoms possible. Comp. Lueret.
III, ²443 Diog. L. X, 66; Stob. Ecl. 1, 52, p. 798. From this similarity

of nature it comes that the impressions of the gods are perccived directly
and notthrough the medium of the coarser senses‚ according to the fa·
mihar principle of the old physicists similia similibus cognoscuntur,· comp.
Trendelenburg on Aristot. De Anima, pp. 220, 228; or Bonitz on Aristot.
Metaph, p. 161. Sext. Emp. Adv. Logic. I, 116 proves that Democritus
taught this3 comp. Papencordt De Atomicor. Doctr, p. 49 ; and doubtless
Epicurus as well-That γνωστοὺς is precisely the correct expression for
the perception which results from the intluence of the impressions may be
seen from the letter of Epicurus to Herodotus,§ 68, where those things
which are perceived by the senses are called γνωστὰ κατ’ αἱσθησιν; and in
the letter to Menoecea 123 the perception of the gods through the impres·
sions is called γνῶσις ἐναργής, whereas the proper understanding of the
nature of the gods can only be reached by reflection aud reason, the gods
are only λόγῳ drnpnroi.-Finally the words ἐπὶ τὸ oriri> drrorcrciaouivuv
certainly mean that the impressions all have the same effect (ἐπὶ τὸ αὑτὸ
ὰποτὲὶωσμα ἀποτελοῦνται), the same thing that Cotta says c. 39, 109:
fluentium frequenter transitio fit visionum, ute mullis una videatur.

II, 18, 47. a nredioque . . . quantum idema summo. ln order to re-
move all the difficulty from this passage I formerly proposed an emenda·
tion, namely a medioque ubique tantundem absit extremum, striking out
quantum idem a summo, which is only found in a single Ms. in the mar·
gin. l mention this here only to controvert a somewhat prevalent miscon-
ception. Because Cicero, Sallust and the older authors in general only
use ubique in passages where a relative or interrogative pronoun precedes,
qui ubique and the like, and because it very often seems as if ubique in
such passages were equivalent to et ubi, Lachmann, Lucret. IV, 638, p. 251,
has stated with his usual confidence that in the older language and even in
Cicero’s time ubique could nowhere be used in any other sense, and that
it was a gross imperitia to suppose that it could as well he used in the
same manner as the other words compounded with the indefinite que, undi-
que, usque, uterque &c (a usage which still occurs in Horace, ag. Sat. Il,
5, 23). The fact in regard to Cicero and the older writers had been ob·
served by others long before Lachmann; cf. Duker De Latinit. Vett.
I. Ctor, p. 415 (380 ed. lips). We may concede that in very many places
where ubique occurs after a pronoun it may be perfectly well taken for et

ubi,· but that in any passage whatever it can be taken only in this way
