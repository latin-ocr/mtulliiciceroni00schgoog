BOOK IL-Cune. LXII, LXIII, §§ 155-159. 287

chiefly leguminous plants; not however exciusively, but according to
Varro R. R. 1, 23, 2 those quoe velluntur e terra, uon subsecantur ,· quae,
quod ito leguntur, legumina dicta,· and 32, 2: dicta a legendo, quod ea
uon secantur sed vellendo leguntur. Gr. χέδροποι, χέδροπα or χέδροπες,
which is considered as a corruption of χέρδροποι, from χείρ and δρέπω,
Comp. Nicand. Theriac. 6523 ldeler, Arist. Meteor. ΙΙ, p. 526.

129. 23· nisi forto . . . dubitationem adfert, quin . . . To under· {35²}
stand the clause with quin properly we must bear in mind that the sense
of the preceding one is: nam non sane dubitationem offert.

129. 27. bestias hominum gratita. What the Academic might have
replied to this may be gathered, since the corresponding passage in the
third book is lost, from Porphyrius De Abst. 111, 20. See also what Celsus
says and what Origen etr. Cels. IV, 74 answers

129. 30. neque all . . . potuissent. This pluperfect is often used in
this way instead of the imperfect, inasmuch as the possibility of the thing
is represented as the condition which must be fulfilled before the thing
itself can take place. Comp. DeOffic. 11‚3, 12: nequeenim ualetudinis
curatio neque ogni cultura . . ,sine hominum opera ullu esse potuisset: ·
Ibid. c. 4,15: quid enumerem artium multitudinem, sine quibus vita
omuino nulla esse potuisset. In the same way audire potuisses, above I,
21, 57, is to be explained3 andri potuero, often used for si potero is to be
regarded from the same point of view.

[The possibility of happening would seem to be a necessary condition
to the actual happening of any thing whatever; otherwise it would never
happen. The idea of possibility lies here notin the tense, but in the very
signification of the word potuissent ,· and the difference between potuissent
and possent is that the former represents the possibility as existing at some
earlier time. 'lhe idea seems to be that if it were not for the care of men
sheep not only would not now be able to exist and flourish‚ but would never

have been able to do so at any time, according to the original ordinauce of
nature]

129. 35. se asse generatos. Eos would have been more correct: but
the reflexive is used because canes, though not grammatically the subject,
is thought of as such, being implied in canum custodia.

130. 4. abillo aureo genere. Aratus, whom Cicero has in mind lou
here, and from whom he quotes the following verses ¹30 ii, says of the
golden age, v. 110: αὕτως δ’ ἔζωον, χαλεπὴ δ’ ἀπέκειτο θάλασσα, καὶ βίον
oona νῆες ἀπόπροθεν ἠγίνεσκον, ἀλλὰ βόες καὶ ἄροτρα dre. ; but according to
others (as Hesiod W& D. v. 117³ virgil, Georg. Ι, ¹233 Quidnam,

101) the earth produced in abundance in that age ab soris oi inuis Sum·
