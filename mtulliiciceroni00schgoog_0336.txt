BOOK III.-Cnnr.Xth1,XtX,§§ 45-48. 307

Eumenides? quae si deae sunt, quarum . . . lucras Furinae, Furiae dene
sunt &c We have given in the text the emendation of Madvig, adopted
by Baiter Ι and ΙΙ. Schoemann in his Appendix does not venture to adopt
this because it differs too much from the hlss. reading; and thinks that by
placing a colon after Furinae the difficulties are removed. (We omit this
inste in the Appendix.) 'Ibe common text gives this sense: If the Eume·
uides are deities, the Furies are also deifica—which though true is not
important. Madvig's emendation is only a way of untying the knot‚ but at
least gives a reasonable sense] .

150. 28. luens Furinae. Plutarch C. Gracch. c. 17 calls this ᾰλσος
Ἐριννύων, from which it appears that he took the same view with Cicero in
regard to this deity; who according to Varro L. L, V, 84 was little known,
although there wasa Flamen Furinalis and a feast F urinalia.

150· 30. Natio only occurs here; and the form of the name, whether ti
Nescio or Natio, is doubtful. The fact that the Romans paid worship to
her in the territory of Ardea would show that she was a deity especially
belonging to Ardea; possibly the same that Strabo V, 3, p. 376 calls
Aphrodite3 after Ardea became a part of the Roman state the Romans
also joined in her worship, as they usually did in the various religious ob·
servances of annexed states.

150. 35. Moneta appears in this connection as an especial deity, cor·
responding to the Greek Mnemosyne, which is translated in the same way
by others also; whereas in other places and in Cicero himself, De Div. 1,
45, 105, Moneta is a title of Juno, “the warning one,” which she is said to
have received on a special occasion. As the mint was near her temple it
was called after her, ‹fficina Monetam see Liv. VI, 20, 133 and her title
was transferred to coined money.

151. 3. Serapim Isimque. The worship of these Egyptian deities19
had found entrance into Rome as early as the sixth century of the city
(Valer. Max. I, 3, 5), and although it was repeatedly forbidden under pen·
alty it constantly reappeared, until at length it was tolerated and after the
beginning of the eighth century publicly recognized. See Orelli ad Arnob.
II, 73; Preller Rem. Myth, p. 727 and Regionen der Stadt Rom, p. 123.
Τ110 prohibition of the worship of foreign deities did not rest upon a de·
nial of their existence, but rather on the opinion that certain deities and
religions were fitted for some nations but not for others.

151.12. Coloni nostrl Glreelemes. Circeii in the Volscian terri· 48
tory possessed the ius Latii as early as the time of the elder Tarquin.
According to Westphal (Die Rem. Campagna, p. 60) the common people
of that region preserve to this day a reminiscence of the Circe whose tem·
ple Strabo mentions at Circeii (V, 3, p. 232).
