φόρον, Itis true that in Cicero’s time Artemis was involred among 'the
Greeks as tlrc goddess ol childbirth, a iunction which was ascribed to her
as the goddess ol the moon. As early as the tragedians she was repre·
sented as the goddess of the moon.

100. 8. vagantibus, sc. stellis, i.e. the planets. The moon is called
vaga luna in lior. Sat. 1, 8, 21 (see Heindorf in loc). Omnivaga is
found nowhere else. The moon does in lact appear more than other
heavenly bodies to be wandering here and there.

tw roo. 8. Druna...quta noctu quasi diem officeret. There is
some truth in this. Diana denotes the heavenly goddess ol light; from
the root mentioned in the note to c. 2, 4.

100.11. ‘menses’ There is no doubt that the name os the moon,
ptyra, as well as others in the cognate languages‚ really contains the idea
os measuring and signifies the moon as the measurer of time. Comp.
Lassen, Ind. Alterth. 1, 7655 11, 1118. This meaning can be also recog·
nized in priv and meraris. For the various views quoto post conceptionem
mense infantes edi soleant comp. Censorin. De Die Nat. c. 7.

100.12. Tlmaeus ot Tauromenium in Sicily, historiari, at the begin·
ning os the third century uc-The temple at Ephesus was set on tire by
the Ephesian Herostratus to gain for himself an imperishable name, which
he has succeeded in doing. Comp. Soliu. c. 4⁰·

1oo.16. Venerem. Itis quite as certain that the name does not
come from verrin, as it is uncertain whence it really comes. According
to Pictet, Origines Indo-Europ. 11, p. 692, it comes from the Sanscrit van
= colere, servire, irritare, whence also veneror, the old German witz, friend,
and the northern vain.

28 roo. 19. a physicis rebus.. .lnventls‚ ‘⁴ from correct and uselul

w observations ol physica] olrjccts.” For videtisne see 111, 27, 69, note.

1oo. 21. [errores turbulentos “troublesome errors''; our word
“troublesomc'' comes through the French from turbula, with the English
sulfur —soute, German — saw]

1oo. 22. [enlm generally stands second in the sentence except there
be some uuimportant word accompanying the emphatic one. See M. 471,
Obs. 1.]

roo. 23. notl sunt3 ironically3 we act as if we knew them.

100. 27. apud Homerum. ll. XX, oyfl.

roo. 29. oum Titanis, sor Titanibus. This metaplasmus is found
especially in the quotations t'rom Ennius in Lactantius B. Ι., although only
Titan occurs in the nom. sing. But Priscian V, 4, 26 gives also Titanus:
the abl. Titano is found in Varro L. L., Vll, 163 and Lactant. also has
the nom. pl. Titani, which Priscian cites from Naevius.
