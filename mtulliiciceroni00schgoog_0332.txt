For the following sentence commencing with nuno eutem see Rene,
P· 73·

147. 30. Qualem eutem deum intellegere noe possumus &eg
“How can we form for ourselves an idea of a god without virtue l '’ For
intellegere in this signification comp. I, 10, 25 ; 14, 363 11, 21, 54. The
following argumentation is also horrowed from Carneades. See Sext. Emp.
IX, 152 ff. It simply shows however that categories‚ which apply very
well to men and human relations, cannot be transferred to the deity, which
Aristotle has shown in regard to the various virtues Eth. Nic. X, 8. Arno·
bius 1, 31 says oi God: tu es de quo nihil dici et exprimi mortalium potis
est signficatione verborum quid ut intelligaris, tacendum est, atque ut
per umbram te possit errans investigare suspitio, nz’lit est omnino muti·
endum. And III, 19: Quicquid de deo dixeris, quicquid tacitae mentis
cogitatione conceperis, in humanum transilit et corrumpitur sensum, nec
habet propriae significationis notam, quod nostris dicitur verbis atque ad
negotia humana compositis. Unus est hominis intellectus de dei natura
certissimus, si scias et sentias nihil de illo posse mortali oratione depromi.

148. 11. placem syri venerantur; Derceto or Atergatis, a mater· tt
nal natural deity. She had not however quite the form oi a fish, but ac·
cording to Diod. H, 4: τὸ μὲν πρόσωπον ἔχει γυναικός, τὸ cl' ᾰλλο σῶμα πᾶν
igilium or according to Lucian De Dea Syr. c. 14: ἡμισέη μὲν γυνή, τὸ δὲ
ὁκόσον ἐκ μηρῶν ἐς depone πόδας ἰχθύος, Dagon, the god of the Philistines,
also had the form oi a lish, but the head and hands oi a man.

148.13. Alabandus and Tenes or Tenues, the mythical οἰκισταί oi
Alabanda in Caria and oi the island Tenedos on the Trajan coast, were
worshipped as heroes. Alabandis (or Alabandeis) is the Greek form
Ἀλαβανδεῖς. Comp. Schneider Formenlehre, p. 308, and Lachmann'e
Lucretius, p. 281 note. Below c. 19, 50 Cicero uses the Latin form Ala·
bandenses.

148. 14. Leucotheam, quae fult lno dcc. For the iable see the classi·
cal dictionaries. Here it may be remarked that Ino and many others oi the
so·called deified mortals were originally real deities‚ but afterwards fell to
the level of deified heroes, following the vicissitudes of forms ol religion

which were gradually changed and lorgotten.

148. 18. Omitto ssla3 sunt enlm praeclara3 “I pass over the ω
next proposition (i.e. that the universe is God), lor it is all very excel·
lent,”-although not true-as we must suppose the Academic thought;
so that in the praise there is a touch οῖ’ irony which would have been still
more apparentis Cotta had said: rint etiam praeclara, “it may he all very
fine so iar as 1 know.”
