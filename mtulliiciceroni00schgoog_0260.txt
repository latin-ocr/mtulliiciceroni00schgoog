91. 26. neque naturam significat, “points neither to a mere force
of nature‚'’ ie. a blind and unconscious force. For this signification of the
word, which the connection absolutely requires, comp. c. 32, 81 ; 1, 13, 35;
and 111, 11, 27. Signisfeare is used in the same way c. 22, 54: segnificam
eandem mentem atque prudentiam,· and c. 33, 85: tantam naturae sol-
lertiam segnificat,· declarare in the same sense is found in c. 32, 81.

91. 30. aut natura aut vi aut voluntate. lt is plain that natura rt
here denotes the force of nature that works unconsciously in everything,
vis a force that operates from without; to both these is opposed the motion
resulting from free will and inherent power. This view of Aristotle, as well
as that cited above ξ 42, occurred doubtless in the dialogue περὶ φιλοσοφίας.
No passage that exactly corresponds is found in his extant writings, but in
De Caelo ΙΙΙ, 2 he says: ἀνάγκη γὰρ ἢ βίαιον εἶναι τὴν κίνησιν ὴ κατὰ φασιν.
ln the same work 1,2 however he distinguishes a motion of three kinds,
ἐπὶ τὸ μέσον, ἀπὸ τοῦ μέσου, περὶ τὸ μέσον. The last, the circular motion, is
by nature peculiar to what he calls the πρῶται) στοιχεῖον, and what others
call aether ,¹ the heavens and the heavenly bodies are composed of this
πρῶτον στοιχεῖον, their motion being so far a natural one, and yet withal
a voluntary one3 this is to be understood of 'the planets.

91. 33. [in] sublime. The preposition probably was added by copy·
ists, who were unacquainted with the adverbial use of sublime. Comp.
Priscian XVII, 141 and the citatione of Ktihner, Tusc. 1, 17, 40.

92. 15· certa notione animi praesentiamus. This expression, like 145?
the following praesensionem notionemque nostram, refers to the πρόληψις,
which the Stoics believed in, like the Epicureans. See note Ι, 17, 44 and
14, 37. Itis a φυσικὴ ἔννοια (Diog. L. VII, 54), which arises in the mind
without particular reaching or reflexion, iven διδασκαλίας καὶ ἐπιμελείας, in
a natural and simple manner, ἀνεπιτεχνήτως. Plut. Plac. Phil. IV, 11. In
another passage, De Stoic. Rep. c. 17, these προλήψεις are also called ἔμφυ-
τοι in the same sense as Cicero calls them innatas c. 4, 12.- Man has
then a natural preconceived notion of the divine nature, and is convinced
of the substantia] lruth of this notion immediately, intuitively, and without
proof ; and he admits the truth of any further scientific idea of the divine
nature only in so far as he finds it to correspond to this preconceived
notion, so far as he can bring it into harmony with that; this Cicero ex·
presses below hy accommodare; comp. Orat. c. 7, 23: utrum (Demosthe-
nem) accommodare nd earn, qnam sentiam, eloquentiam.

92. 18. primum hunc ipsum mundum. The corresponding deinde
is wanting. The heavenly bodies evidently would come next; but in the
tirade against Epicurus Cicero forgets so entirely the form of the sentence,
