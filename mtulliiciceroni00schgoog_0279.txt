represented a Greek, the poet certainly erred in making the speaker refer
to the Romans as nostri, and so to the Greeks as strangers. The criticism .
of Cicero is just. The following words At Latine quuitur contain anob·
jection to this criticism, which is however immediately answered. This
objection, says Cicero, would only hold if we were not obliged really to
imagine the speaker as a Greek; but the poet himself in the following
verse of the same piece shows us expressly that we must do so. —Evi
dently the whole digression is introduced to give an appearance of the
greater ease of friendly conversation, as also in III, 10, 25.
92 107. 17. ex aethere...existunt. Comp.c.15init.

107. 22. mota loeo for moti, the speaker still thinking of sidera.

107. ²3· conflagrare. Cicero was writing hastily and left out of
account the possible alternative that the earth might also grew cold if the
sun were to move away from it.

{37 ¹07· 29. unlus et viginti . . .lltterarum. That is the number of

letters in the Latin alphabet; forY and Zare foreign to the Latin lan·
guage and only used in Greek wor·ds; so that Quintil. 1, 4, 9 calls X the
last of the Latin letters. Comp. Priscian I, 15 and Corssen lib. Aussprachc
&c.; Ι, p. 7. [For the order of the words, adjectives with adjectives &c

107. 31. annales Ennii. An epic poem containing the Roman his·
tory up to the time of the poet, the beginning of the sixth century.

¹07· 32. quod neseio. The relative pronoun serves to recall what
precedes, in this case posse . . . annales Ennii effici,- and the sentence
would be grammatically complete without the following words teritum va·
lere fortuna, which only contain the same idea in another form. Comp.
note c. 9, 24.

94 108.1. quam ποιότητα Graeci vocant. Cicero adds this remark
because the Greek word was quite familiar to his readers, but the Latin
word was frrst coined by himself, as he says Acad. I, 6, 24, where he recl(-
ons it among the verbis inauditis. The Greek ποιότης too was first coined
by Plato, as is remarked in his life in Westermann’s Biogr., p. 393, as well
asin other· places. The word occurs in Theaet, p. 182 A, where Plato him·
sels calls it an ἀλλόκοτον ὄνομα,

108. 9. qui loeus ost proximus, according to the division given
above c. 30, 75. As Balbus has in fact been treating of this part of the
argument since c. 36, he calls attention to it as it were in a supplementary
way. This is not to be regarded as an error of Cicero, but is a part of

the imitation of extempore discourse, wlirch very weh abuius ai the finiar

innatare <see note c. 7, 20).
