330 DE NATURA DEORUM.

Ac. 111, p. 363. -That ignem in the succeeding clause is not to be under·
stood of the common earthly as opposed to the etherial lire, as the most
recent translator has it, would be evident, not only from the note to the
passage and what is said in the summary of the second book, p. 73, but
from the position alone of ignem in the phrase, which would be hard to
explain if the common fire were really intended.

1, 19, 49. A. Brieger (Beitr. zur Kritik einig. phil. Schr. des Cicero,
Posen, 1873) has rightly remarked that in the words eam esse vim et na-
turane dearum, ut nau sensu sed mente cernatur the phrase mente cerni,
opposed to sensu cerui, can mean nothing but the ψυχικὴ ulainais, in.
the simple perception by the faculty which Lucretius calls the niens
animi, and in which the feeling, perceiving and thinking capacity of the
soul dwells. The same statement is therefore made here as in Lucret. V,
149, tenuis enim natura deum longeque remota sensibus a nastris animi
vix mente uidetur. But we must not neglect the difference of vis et na·
tura dearum and tenuis natura deum. The latter, on account of the
epithet tenuis, can only be understood of the divine quasi corpus which
the mind perceives, because in virtue of its possessing the same tenuitas it
isin immediate contact with and directly affected by it; the vis et natura
dearum is something more than this quasi corporeality, and denotes the
whole outer and inner constitution upon which the vitae actia and the
mentis agitatio (ξ 45 ff), virtue, wisdom, happiness and immortality of
the gods depend. If in the passage under discussion we are to under-
stand simply the corporeality of the gods, of which we are cognizant by
mere perception, Cicero could not have written cernatur, which would
only admit ais et natura forits subject, but cernantur, sc. di, which l
(Prof. Sch.) have therefore restored. The perceptible tenuitas of the gods,
although not the same as their vis et natura, still is a part of it, is one side
of their being, and may therefore as depending upon this be designated by
ut ,· it lies in the nature of the gods that their corporeality as well should
be perceivable only by the niens, and not by the senses. ln the Greek
original which Cicero used there was probably an infinitive depending on
ὥστε, perhaps γιγνώσκεσθαι, which could be rendered in Latin by the singu-
laras well as by the plural of the finite verb. Thus Cotta in his reply
(ξ 105) takes the proposition as applicable only to the corporeality and
not to the collective being of the gods, and speaks of the speciem dei be·
cause this alone in the gods is what we immediately perceive, quad mente
cernitur. When Cicero makes him say percipi cogitatione instead of the
mente cerni of Velleius. we may regard it as the result of the same haste
apparent in other passas 'rich caused him to overlook

the difference betw
