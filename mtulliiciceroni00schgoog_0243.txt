is not so because Cotta had finished his discourse and because, as Balbus
knew, the Academie had nothing positive to say ou the subject; Balbus
calls attention to it this way. The tense of inducat may be more than an
oversight. “I should have preferred to hear Cotta continue his speech
rather than leave off where be did, and see how he gets on when he comes
to propounrl a system of positive theology ; he ought to have one and 1
am curious to know what it is.”]

a 79. 3. istam quaestionem. This pronoun is used because the per·
son addressed is the one who proposes the discussion, and who also last
spoke. On iste referring to the person addressed see Reisig, Vorl. 5 209.

2 79. 16. Ennius, who more thau any one else made the Romans

4 acquainted with the works and various forms of Greek poetry, modelled
his tragedies chiefly upon the plays of Euripides. The verse here quoted
is from the Thyestes. For others of similar import see below c. 25, 65.

79. 18. Iovem. The ancients recognized the fact that the name Iovis
(properly Diovis) signified “the heavenly” (see Varro L. L., V, 66), and
modern comparative philology has confirmed it. dium too means the
heavens, the bright sky, which spreads the light of day (dies) over the
carth. Ζεὺς, Ace-te, deus, (irrigare ofthe sameroot; and the supreme
being hears the distinetive name of “heavenly father,” Dius paler, Dius·
piler, Diespiter, luppiter. The Stoic however completely identifies God

with the heavens, indeed he makes the heavenly ether God, as older phi·
losophers had already done before him, whose views Euripides assigns to
his heroes in some of his tragedies.-In the following illum vero et
Iovem Balbus has iu mind the supposed derivation of the name from

79. 21. patrem divumque dc, equivalent to the Homeric πατὴρ
ἀνδρῶν τε θεῶν re, The Stoic however understands thereby the creator,
while in Homer and the other poets the name Zeus does not designate the
creator, bnt only a paternal ruler; this is noted by Arist. Polit. I, 12.
cf. Div. Chrys. Or. XII, 75: πατὴρ δὲ (Ζεὺς) καλεῖται διά τε τὴν κηδεμιν
