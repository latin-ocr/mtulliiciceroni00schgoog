49. 23. Philo noster. See c. 3, 6. Although it cannot be stated with
certainty, yet it is very probabie that Cicero here attributes to Cotta what
was really true of himself. Also c. 28, 79 ; 33, 93.

49. 30. [bona venia me audies, excuse me for saying so, ie. for the
use of the epithets tam levis, tam ineptas]

49. 33. [inphysicis. Under this head the ancients brought the ques-oo
tion of the existence of the gods]

50· 5. Simonide, the famous lyric poet from Ceos, who, like nisti
somewhat younger contemporaries, Pindos, AEschylus and his nephew
Bacchylides, lived often and for a long time at Syracuse at the court of
the elder Hiero With what is said of him here comp. what Tertullian
Ad Nat. II, 2, p. 183 Oehl. says of Thales: Thales Milesius Croeso scisci-
tanti, quidde deis arbitraretur, post aliquot deliberandi cornmeatus nihil
renuntiavit.

50· ιο. quid dicit, quod . . . esset. Sit would have been more cor· ol
rect; but as the preceding dicit is used irregularly (though the assertions
of Epicurus may be considered as present and still subsisting in his
writings or in tradition), Cicero might properly use esset in the rela-
tive clause, just as if dixit had preceded in the principal one. Siniilar
examples may be found above c. 15, 39 (fluerent atque manarent), ibid.
40 (appellarent), III, 28, 70 (uterentur); others may be found in Reisig,
Haase’s note No. 5oo; and iladvig, Cic. De Fin, p. 464.

50.13. [difficile est negare. A proposition to be answered in the
next sentence-ln contione, ie. before a public assembly, on grounds
of public policy; but there is no difficulty in denying the proposition in
huiusmodi sermone, in a familiar conversation among ourselves.]

50.14. consessu. [Schoemann reads iu consessu and says]: if the
preposition is allowed to stand here, we must assume that some word like
hoc or tali has fallen out before consessu.

50· 15. ogo ipse . . . is. The repeated reference by the demonstra·
tive pronoun serves to bring out the contrast more plainly. Comp. note to
111, 39, 93. [The pronoun is here repeats the subject ego, of the first
person; it refers in sense to pontifex and qui . . . arbitror ,· “as pontifex,
and as holding the opinion doc. (qui . . . arbitror), under these circum·
stances (is) Ι should desire ’' dre. It is used with reference to the first or

second person only where it has the force of talis. Cic. Phil. II, 30, 76:
qui magister equitum fuisse tibi viderere . . . is per municipia coloniasque '
Galliae. . . cum Gallicis et lacerna cucurristi. The usage is to be distin·
guished from that referred to by Prof. Schoemann in III, 39, 93. Where
idem is used there are two predicates‚ expressed or implied, belonging to
