logue bearing his name as giving his views about God and the creation
ol the world; and it is undeniable that much oi the Pythagorean doc-
trine, which may really bave been taught by Timaeus, is contained in that
dialogue. Hence Platonis de T imaeo deum bere is equivalent to de
T imaeo acceptum, “the god of Plato, that Timaeus taught him.” It is
generally considered that the extant treatise π. ψυχᾶς κόσμου ml φύσιος
bearing the name of Timaeus is a comparatively recent forgery.

pressiori in some ol his Greek predecessors. Plutarch repeats the same,

moreover misrepresents the Stoic view in speaking of the Pronoea as an
individual person, and he is therefore corrected by Balbus below ll, 29,

38.11. mundum ipsum. The Stoics considered the universe as
God, in so lar that they held it to be endowed with a sonl, and to be per-
meated if not by an immaterial, yet bya thinking and willing principle,
namely the liery ether, just as the human body is by the soul; the doc·
trine is developed in detail in the second book c. 811. Compare note to
c.14,37.

38.17. tanti munerla, i.e. tanti operis. The two expressions are
united in Cicero Tusc. l, 28, 70: moderator tanti operis et muneris: and
below II, 35, 90: architectum tanti operis tantique muneris. Munus is
especially used ol public buildings, as temples or theatres, constructed at
private expense.
