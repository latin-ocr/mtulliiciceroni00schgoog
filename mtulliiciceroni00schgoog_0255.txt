durescit umor, “when the cold substance contained in the north winds or
other objects comes to unite itseli with the water.” So what follows
directly about the air, mullo calore adrnixtus, as also a few lines before
adntr'xtum esse calorem refer to the admixture of the ,material heat which
is the ether.
rt 87. 3. oritur ex respiratione aquarum. See c. 33, 84: Nam ex
terra aqua, ex aqua oritur air, ex aire aether. -Below c.45, 117 however
the warmth of the air is explained by the proximity oi the ether.
87. 5. quam similitudinem = cuius rei similitudinem or c. r. sitm'le
quid. Comp. De Fin. V, 15, 42: ea sequimur ad quae nati sumus
Quam similitudinem videmus in bestiis ,· and ibid. suam cuique rei natu·

stituent parts. Comp. c. 12, 32: nulla pars corporis est, quae non minoris

ῙῙ 87. 16. Natura est igitur. Natura is not the subject but the predi·

the diflerence between this and the earthly tire, fire in its narrower sense,

87. 19. oum alio iuncta atque conexa. More correctly it would
have been: expluribus iuncta et composita. ’liv παντὶ πολυμερεῑ σώματι
