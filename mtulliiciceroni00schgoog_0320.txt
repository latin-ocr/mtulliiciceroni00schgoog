pared myself well, as 1 had to doto meet such an antagonist as the Stoic;3
whereas to meet an Epicurean required no particular preparation. Cotta
had said before (§ 1) that he was preparing himself during the discourse
of Balbus to reply to it: quid contra dicerem, meditabar,· and when he
remarks there, as well as below in §4, that he hopes not so much to refute
Balbus as to beg for further explanation on several points, we recognize
not only the Academia philosopher despairing of further knowledge, but
the man of the world paying a compliment; not without a touch of irony
too which does not escape Balbus, who answers: sin me interrogare voles
non tam intellegendi causa quam refellendi uc. Sic, instead of si, an
error of the copyists, is similarly used by Cicero in De Fin. Ill, 2, 9: iam
infici debet iis artibus, quas si, dum cst tener, combiberit, ad maiora veniet
paratior.-Sic; etquidem diligentius saepiusque ista loquemur inter
nos &c.; cf. Madvig's note. See also Wopkens Lectt. Tull, p. 171, Hand’s

younger, whom Cicero introduces as the speaker in his discourse on friend-
ship. He was called by his contemporaries the wise man, sapiens, and
above 11, 66, 166 heis mentioned with Coruncanius, Scipio and others as
one 0f the good men especially beloved by the gods. His oratio nobilis,
