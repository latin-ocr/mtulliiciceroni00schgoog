θρεπτική only, beasts with a ψυχὴ αἱσθητική besides, men with a λογική
also. Comp. Arist. De. An. II, 33 Maerob. In Somn. Scip. I, 14, 73 and

19, 23.

13 88. 34. Quartus autem gradus. It is evident that while the first
three grades are known by experience, the fourth is only assumed to eom·
plete the series, which otherwise would not include the most perfect beings,
as is seen from ξ 35.

88. 35. natura bont sapientesque. Comp. Senec. Epist. 95: di im·
mortales necllum didicere virtutem, cum omni editi, et pars naturae eorum
estesse bonos. Φίοει καθαροὶ καὶ ἀκήρατοι in Epict. IV, 11, 3. Deorum
virtus natura excellit, hominum autem industria, Cic. Top. c. 20, 76.

89.1. ratio reeta constansque; reason that always hits the mark,
true to itselt', never falling into contradiction with itsels: λόγος ὀρθὸς καὶ
ὀμοΙογοίνμενος καὶ βέβαιος καὶ ἀμετάπτωτος (Plut. De Virt. Mor. c. 3); to
think and aet in conformity with this is wisdom and virtue.

The recto ratio is supra hominem putanda only in so tar as regards
an inborn reason, not one that is gradually developed and brought to per-
fection. For although man very seldom really reaches it, it is not to be
thought utterly impossible; homo enim sopiens fieri potest he says below
§3⁶- But comp. De Offic. III, 4, 16; De Amic. c. 5, 18.

35 89. 4. in ulla rerum instltutione, in the case ot' any organized sys-
tem of things ; of any things which are arranged by nature or by man.

89. 9. in omni natura, ie. in renz'oersa natura or rerum omnium
notura, hence in rorando. On rerum omnium natura, which is here at
least as fitting as r. omnis n. comp. Schoem. Opusc. Ac. 111, p. 362. [ac
connects sic and medlo onogis; “in the same manner and in much higher
degree.'']

36 89. 25. deterior potrus. potius is by no means superfluous, merely
strengthening deterior. On the contrary it alone really serves tor the eom-
parison os the two members; the assertionis that the predicate deterior
would he applicable to the condition of the mundus rather than to that of
man. The comparison to which the comparative deterior points is not
fully developed in the sentence, because it is easily understood without
that; we may supplement thus, deterior de duobus.

37 89. 31- undique aptum: “on all sides, ie. in all respects suitably
arranged.'’ — omnibus suls numeris et partibus. The second expres·
sion mighthave been omitted; sor numeri often deuotes all the essential
parts of a thing, conformably to the Greek usage ; asin Diog. L. VII, 100:
τὸ τέλειον ἀγαθὸν παρὰ τὸ πάντας ἀπέχειν τοὺς ἐπιζητουμένους ἀριθμοὺς ὑπὸ
τῆςφὺσεως,
