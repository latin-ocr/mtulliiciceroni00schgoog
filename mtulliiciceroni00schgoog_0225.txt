55. 3. eam esse causam dre. ¹ This part of the sentence can only de·
pend on quid ocinum, and would force the reader to take the preceding si
... putaret as an inserted conditional clause, and not, as would be most
natural, with quid ocinum directly. Besides, as it here stands, it presents
a violation os the consecutio temporum not easy to explain. Finally, it is
evidently quite superfluous3 and would have been better test out, if indeed
Cicero really wrote it. Comp. Schoem. Opusc. Ac. III, 317. 18.
