there follows something which has no necessary connection with what pre·
cedes, namely that the reason which dwells in man forces usto acknowledge
also a reasonable principle in the universe from which the human reason
is derived. One would think that Cicero had quoted from his original
authority rather carelessly.

84. 2. quibusdam regionibus atquo urbibus. See below c. 16, 4²·

18 84. 5. Et tamen, ic. in spite of all its imperfectiori the human reason
is of such sort that we can only explain it as an outflow from a higher
divine reason. Comp. c. 31, 79. aliam quam would perhaps beabettcr
reading than aliquam: for the circumstances are different iu passages
where aliquis seems to be equivalent to alius quis ,· see Haase's note to
Reisig, p. 338. .

84. 8. apud Xenophontem. Memor. I, 4, 8: νοῦν δὲ μόνον ἄρα
οὐδαμοῦ ὄντα σὲ εὐτυχῶς πως dorcic συναρπάσαι, comp. below 111, 11, 27;
Tusc. V, 13, 38: humanus autem animus, decerptus ex mestre divina,
cum alio ncdla uisi cum ipso deo, sr' hccsas est dictu, comparari potest.

84. 10. terrenam . . mimorum soliditatem = viscera solida ct ter·
rena. Viscera includes not only the intestines but everything except skin,
bones and blood. Comp. below e.'63 extr. ; Tusc. II, 14, 34: Spartae
pueri ad aram sic vcrbcribus accipiuntur, ut nztcltus c visceribus sanguis
excat: Lactant. De Opif. Dei, c. 7: deus ossa visceribus operuit. Hence
visceratio, κρεανομία. -Ochsner, Ecl. cic, p. 22 has correctly remarked
that arrianam z'llau would be more correct than the animum illum of the
Mss.

19 84. 24. tot rebus ipsis se inmutantibus, “ by the transformation
of so many things within themselves ''; iu. their being subject to a trans·
formation which takes place ln themselves by a process having its movIng
spring within themselves. Evidently the changes in plants are meant,
where the plant is developed from the seed, the fruit from the flower; and
these changes stand in so close connection with tlre nearness or remoteness
of the sun, that one ean infer its position from them. Comp. Plin. H. N.
XVIII, 27. The ancients however spealr also of many other changes that
go on in plants and beasts coinciding exactly with specified seasons of the
year3 examplcs may be found in Cic. De Diu. I, 9, 163 II, 14, 33; Theo·
phrast. IIlst. Plant. Ι, 16; Gellius N. A. IX, 7, 1 and others. The abla-
tives solstitiis brzemisque are not to be taken with cognosci, but serve asa
more precise definition to accessus discessusque. -SolstltIum, although
proper-ly it denotes the winter as well as the summer solstice‚ is regularly
used to menn the latter and opposed to bruma or hiems. Iuven. IV, 9²²
sic utullus tientes alque octogesima vidit solstitia. Comp. Gesn. on Varro

R. Il. I, 46.
