visum ior the Greek φαντασία, as iu Acad I, 11, 40 aud 11, 6, 18, and this
is one reason why Heindorf brackets this whole sentence ; Baiter does
the same.]—The construction at the end oi the sentence is not quite
regular. It would be more correct were it either quae . . . sapientis vitam
regerent or quibus . . . sapientis vila regeretur. As it is, quae quam·
quam can only be equivalent to et quamquam haec, and one would rather
expect iis sapientis vitam regi, so that both clauses, multa esse probabilia
and iis . . . regi connected by quae (lor et haec), would depend on exstitit.
But such irregularity is easily explained and excused.

36.11. perciperentur. This expression, like comprehendere with
which it is often coupled, especially in the Lucullus, denotes a periectly
certain and undoubted knowledge and comprehension oi an object, the
ἀσφαλὴς καὶ βεβαία καὶ ἁμετάθετος κατάληψις of the Stoics.

θ 36. 15· omnes, qul . . .ludloent, ie. all those who pronounce a
¹³ distinct judgment; the Dogmatics in contradistinction to the Academias
who reirained srom any such judgment: nullam rem aperte iudicant,
§113 comp. Ill, 40, 95: eaquae disputari disserere malui quam iudi·
care. [But why are the Dogmatics summoned rather thau any others?
and in point ol fact the Acadeuric bears a most important part in the
dialogue. The natural meaning of qui . . . iudicent would seem to be “to
consider the sententias philosophorum in medio positos and judge which ot'
them are true ''; iudicare quae sit earum vero can hardly mean “to hold
aclear opinion ou the question in general ”; earum must refer to senten·
tias preceding. The sentence seems to be rather an awkward appeal to
all the world, in the same vein as the quotation srom Caecilius just below]
36.18. (est) in Synephebls. The verb is wanting iu the Mss. Syn·
ephebi was the title ol a sabula palliolo ol Caecilius Statius, a younger
contemporary ol Plautus. The Greek original was by Menander. -The
first two oi the verses cited are regular trochaic tetrameters; the other two
were doubtless of the same metre, but, whether by the fault ol Cicero or
that of the copyists‚ have gotten into confusion. [non vult3 nevolt

14 36. 29. auspiciis, quibus nos praesumus. Cicero had been a
member ol the college os Augurs since the year 700 of the city, the 54th
ol his age. He also wrote a book De Auguria, probably after the De Nat.
Deor. and De Divin. See the fragments in Orelli IV, 2, p. 478.
