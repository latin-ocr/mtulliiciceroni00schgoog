frages, we should arrive at me conclusion that the most and the best rather
agreed with the Stoic (11, 66), and that the sort of sels-confident reliance
on one’s own strength aud goodness which thinks to get on without the
help of ὼε deity was an illusion that became more and more general after
the time of me sophists‚ but was never the prevailing view of really classi·
cal antiquity. Of course it was understood thu even the gods do not
make a man virtuous without or against his will ; he must meet mem half
way, he must desire their aid and have the will on his part to coh'perate
in the work of virtue. In this sense the poet says: ἐνμέσῳ κεῖται κιχεῖν
πᾶσιν ἀνθρώποις δίκαν ὁσίαν (in Clem. Alex. Strom. V, 12, 137) ; and this
is the idea of Plato Rep. X. 617 E: ἀρετὰ ἁδέσποων, ἣν τιμῶν καὶ ἀτιμάζων
nisime, καὶ ἔλαττον αὐτῆς ἕκαστος ἔξει· αἰτία ἐΙωμένου, θεὸς ἁναὶτιοςι a passage
which has been wrongly cited by some commentators of Cicero as agreeing
with the views of Cotta.

164 33. Herculi decumam vovit3 areference to the oft-mentioned 88

164. 35. Pythagoras. Tm story is told of several persons3 accord-
ing to Diog. Laert. VIII, 12 the proposition discovered was the so·called
problem of Pythagoras or reragister matheseos. The doubt expressed by '
Cotta is solved according to some by assuming that the ox was only one of ,
dougln

165. 5. Quamvls llcet. Other examples of this easily-explained
usage may be found in Kiihner's Tusc. IV, 24, 53 note.

165. 9. ub Diogenes dleebat. A reference to the saying cited above

c. 34, 83.

165. 12. Diagoras. See note bn Ι, 23, 63. The same story is toldig
of Diogenes the Cynic instead of Diagoras, Diog. L. VI, 59.

165. 13· atquo ei quidam amicus. The omission of the verbum
dicendi is not so violent as to prove the passage necessarily corrupt. Cf.
F. A. Wolf Verm. Schr.‚ pp. 159, 160. Tac. Hist. IV, 75: ad ea Cerialis
Ciuili et Classico nihil. Tm verb for nescio quid is also wanting above c. 5.

165. 14. ex bot tabulis pictis, ie. of votive tablets. Schol. Cruq. ad

aut aliquo loco publico, inqua descripta d. e. depicta est fortuna alicuius.
Ita solent naufragi suune naufragium in tabella depictum . . . in tenplis
alicui deo consecratum suspendere. The Samothracian deities especially
were invoked by mariners.

Balbus but of any opponent whatever; inquitis often so used.
