nite number of conserving forces3 and in like manner that for the great
number of mortal beings there must bean equal number of immor-
tal beings3 and we can imagine only the gods as corresponding to
this conception (5ο).1 But if with the Stoics we suppose the uni·
verse itself to be God, or if we accept the existence in the universe
of a God that governs it, we only inflict upon the deity a burden and
a care, which isin plain contradiction with the idea of happiness
(51, 52). Nor is there any need of a divine ruler or creator of the
world, since it has arisen from atoms by the force ol nature3 and
not only one, but innumerable worlds have come, are coming and s
will continue to come into being in the same manner (53, 54). The
Stoic doctrine inflicts upon men rulers, of whom they must be in
continual dread; it leads to a belief in a necessary fatality, in sooth-
saying and the like3 from which the doctrine of Epicurus makes
them free, and inspires them with reverence for the gods without
aur fear (sss )- ι
After this exposition of the Epicurean philosophy Cotta com·
mences his discourse in refutation of it. He opens, after a few
compliments to Velleius, with the declaration, in conformity with the
principles of his school, that he is much more capable of detecting
what is false, than of ascertaining what is true; and that he finds
himself, with respect to the question in debate, in the same position
with the poet Simonides, namely, that the longer he thinks on the
subject, the more obscure it seems to him (57-60). He is very lar
from disputing the existence of the gods3 he believes in it heartily3
but if it be a question of substituting for this faith a knowledge
, based upon logical proos, he cannot allow the arguments adduced by
Velleius to be convincing. For the circumstance adduced by Vel-
leius, that all men believe in the existence of gods, is neither a proof

of that existence, nor itself correct as a matter of fact (ὁὶ-64).
Nor is he any more satisfied with what was said of the essence and

1The reversing of the order ol these two propositions in Cicero has led to
the misunderstanding that the gods are to be considered as the conserving
forces; which of course would be in direct contradiction with the view of
Epicurus; for this reason Zeller, Philos. d. Gr. ΙΙΙ, 1, p. 240¹ n. 1, regards the
phrase about the conserving and destroying forces as an erroneous addition
of Cicero’s. But Cicero merely intended, after giving the contrast between
morlai and immortal, to add that os the destroying and conserving forces, which
really underlies the other.
