64 156. 1. Neptunum esse dlcls animum &a This refers to 11, 28, 71,
where the language differs, but the sense is the same. The phrase idom
de Cerere is only a passing hint, which the reader is expected to complete
for himself.

156. 6. qualis tu eos esse vis. After these words something has
evidently fallen out: non esse scio, or the like.

65 156.15. After Sed there is a long break, comprising the whole third
part of the argument, setting forth the objections against the divine provi·
dence, and a part of the fourth, against the particular care of the gods for
men; all of which is lost

Ennius, corresponding to vv. 365 ff. of the tragedy of Euripides: ἀλλ’ obn
rubrn ταῦτα, μὴ δοκεῖτέ πω, te eid ἀγῶνες τοῖς νεωστὶ νυμφίοις, καὶ τοῖσι
κηδεῦσασιν οὐ σμικροὶ πόνοι, δοκεῖς γὰρ dv με τόνδε donciani ποτ’ ἄν,-
The following ille traversa mente dic. come from the same source and
correspond to vv. 371, 398-9 of Euripides, although the translation in both
cases is not quite correct. The remaining verses in §§ 66 and 67 have no
corresponding ones iu the Medea of Euripides; but they may still have
existed iu that of Ennius, inasmuch as the plays of the Roman dramatists
were not simple translations, but more or less free adaptations of the Greek
originals.

68 157.17. maior mihi moles dec. From the Atreus of Attius, cited
also in De Orat. III, 58 and Tusc. IV, 36.

27 157. 21. This and the eight following verses are from the same tragedy
of Attius. They are the words of Atreus, who complains of his brother
Thyestes for having seduced his wife Adrope. Jllexe, an old syncopated
form for illexisse ,· so despexe Plaut. Mil. Glor. ΙΙ, 6, 72, surrexe Hor. Sat.
I, 9, 73, divisse II, 3, 169, and other similar examples in Lucretius. -The
succeeding verses Adde hue dic. refer to another crime of Thyestes.
Atreus had received from Hermes a ram with golden wool, on the posses·
sion of which the duration of his authority depended. Thyestes with the
aid of Aerope stole it.

69 158. 1. videturne. Occasionallya question is introduced by the
simple enclitic ne where an affirmative answer is expected and nonne
might be used in its place. Cf. De Offie. III, 17, 68: suntne egitur insi-
diae, tendere plagas, and the remarks of Heusinger and Beier. Videsne?
Videtisne? are especially common. So in German Sienst dn wohl? might
often be used for Siehst du nicht? See II, 28 init, and below c. 34, 833
Tusc. II, 11, 26; 21, 503 22, 533 Rosc. Am. c. 24, 66; Hand Turseli.
