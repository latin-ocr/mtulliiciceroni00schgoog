means of various animals, of celestial pheuomeua, especially lightning dre.
harioli were soothsayers, who made a business of foretelling the future
from all sorts of signs for pay; they are always mentioned with contempt,
while the augurs at Rome were a corporation composed of distinguished
citizens, and the haruspices, though Etruscans, and hence foreigners (ΙΙ,
411), formed a college and were often consulted ou affairs of state. vates
were inspircd seers, prophets; coniectores were interpreters of dreams.

48. 35. Hts terroribus. This idea, like that noticed above c. 16, 43,
is characteristic of the school. The Epicureans considered it as one of the
greatest merits of their master that he had freed them not only from
superstition, but from every sort of fear of the gods. Comp. Lucret. Book
V at the beginning, and Plutarch, Non posse suaviter vivi dte. c. 8.

not so much to make a discourse myself, as to draw you out, and to hear
what you could say in answer.

person very well known to those present, whom for this reason it was uu·
necessary to name3 and as in De Or. ΙΙΙ, 21, 78 the orator L. Crassusis
called a santiliaris of Velleius, this seems to have induced some old critic

Romans togatis after their national costunre would be rather expected 1101110
foreigner, and may be defended by similar passages as De Orat. Ι, 24, 111 ;
ΙΙΙ, 11, 43 ; but it is not known that L. Crassus was particularly well versed
in philosophy, especially that of Epicurus 01 that he was the champion of it
at that time ; but this he must have been to make it possible for Cotta to
appeal to his judgmcnt as he does here. For these reasons we are in·

the Epicurean Phaedrus, who perhaps stood in a similar intimate relation
to Velleius as Diodotus did to Cicero. See c. 3, 6.

pronoun being easily understood is often omitted. Comp. ΙΙ, 46, 117; 61,

of Philodemus and Epicurus too confirm it. Minime aptum addicendum
