151. 22. Erechtheus according to the story perished in the war
against the inhabitants of Eleusis under Eumolpus, after he had slain the
latter. For this reason Cotta here couples his name with that of Codrus
who likewise died for his country. Erechthus was originally a surname of
Poseidon, like AEgeru, 11 was also perpetuated in the public worship in the
title Ποσειδῶν Ἐρεχθεὺς. Τ110 temple, the Ἐρεχθεῖον, was on the Acropolis,

mouth. Epitaph.,§ 295 Rg. Theokrin,§ 18), as if his name had been
Leon ,· so after the same analogy the daughters might be called Leontides.

151. 35. Stratonicus, an Athenian player on the cithara, famous 101
his witty sayings, 01 which Athenaeus VIII, p. 348 1. gives some examples;
