BOOK IL—Cime. XI, XII, ξς 27-33. 243

οὑ κοτὰ τὸν αὑτὸν τρόπον, ἀλλ’ ἐφ’ ὧν μὲν κατὰ τὰς ῥίζας, ἐφ’ ὠν δὲ κατὰ
τὴν κόμην, ἐφ’ ὠν δὲ κατὰ τὸ ἐγκάρδιον. Ὥστε, ἐπεὶ καὶ ὁ κόσμος ὑπὸ odoror
διοικεῖται πολυμερὴς καθεστώς, εἰη dv τι iv αὐτῷ τὸ κυριεῦον καὶ τὸ προκαταρ-
χόμενον τῶν κινήσεων· οὐδὲν δὲ δυνατὸν εἶναι τοιοῦτον ἢ τὴν τῶν ὄντων φῦσιν,
ῆτις θεός ἐστιν, Kiihner.]

87. 34. omnem vim mundl natura dIvIna continui-13 “the uni· 3⁰
verse, with all that pertaIns to its being and idea, depends for its existence
and maintenance upon a divine being that pervades it.” For contineri
comp. ξ 29 init. Instead of it we have § 28 init. sustineri ,¹ below retineri ,·
and ξ 31 teneri ,· which all come to the same thing.

88. 1. ad sensus commovendos. The phrase in the Greek original
was perhaps πρὸς κίνησιν αἰσθήσεως or αἰσθητικήν, i.e. for the activity of
the perception and consciousness; whereas Cicero's words have reference
rather to a working on the senses, which is not in question here.

88. 2. hir noster calor, ie. the natural heat that pervades the world
immediately surrounding us, the earthly beings ; not the common fire as
opposed to the elemental fite, as a recent commentator imagines. For this
common fire according to § 41 is consector consumptorque omnium, whereas
hic noster calor is that heat thch preserves and vivifies things, the θερμότης
ψυχική, as Aristode calls it, De Gen. Anim. 111, 11. Comp. above p. 73,
Remarlc.

88. 9. mundo valentius. Comp. Ps. Aristot. De Mundo c. 5: τίς 31
γὰρ ἂν εἰη φύσις τοῦδε (τοῦ κόσμου) κρείττων.

88. 10. Audiamus enlm Platonem. The following proposition fromdg
Plato Is not cited apropos of what immediately precedes, nam quid...
tencatur, which is rather ‚to be regarded as a sort of parenthesis; but of
the clause preceding that, namely praesertim cum . . . moveatur, and to
give the reason why this clause was presented as the chief argument for the
proposition that the mundi ardor (αἰθήρ) is a being endowed with percep·
tion and thought. The passage of Plato which Cicero refers to is found in
Phaedr, p. 245 C, § 51, and is translated Tusc. I, 23.—For esse before
ponit, which some have objected to, comp. Acad. I, 5, 19: corporis autem
alia ponebant esse in toto', alia inpartibus: and other examples in Madvig
De Fin. V, 25, 73.

88. 26. imbuatis: imperfectis. Comp. De Leg. I, 9, 27: prima et 8³
inchoata intellegentia ,· Off. I, 43, 153: cognitio manca er inchoata.

88. 28. Primum enlm. Instead of the corresponding secundo or
deinde we have § 34 autern as very often happens-The order of beings
here corres'ponds to the order of their souls, which the StoIcs dIstinguished,
therein agreeing with Aristotle. Plants are endowed with a ψυχὴ porreiras
