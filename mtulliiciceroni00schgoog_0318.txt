served, were regarded only as indications whether the gods were favorable
or not to any proposed undertaking; they were supposed, as it is expressed
in De Harusp. Resp. c. 9, to give rerum bene gerendarum auctoritatem,
a guaranty for the successful issue; and when the praedictis augurum
are spoken of we are to understand not prophecies of future events, but
only general assurances of a happy issue, or warnings against disaster.
Aves eventus significant aut adversos aut secundos, De Div. ΙΙ, 37, 79.
So here providentis to be taken only of the care on the part of the augurs
that nothing should be undertaken against the wish ol the gods as aseer·
tained by the auspices. How important their sphere ol action was may be
seen from Cic. De Leg. ΙΙ, 12, 31.

131. 7. vaticinationibus, the utterances ot inspired seem, like those
of the Sibylline books which passed at Rome for state oracles, those oi ,
the old Marcii fratres and others. See De Div. 1, 2, 4 ; 40, 89.

131. 8. multae saepe res . . . partae. The sense is: warnings and
prognostics oi this sort make it possible formeri to attain many things
according to their desires (ex sententia), and to further their interests
(utilitates). utilitates serves to define the general expression res. The
reading oi the Mss. hominum sententia (without ex) atque utilitate is evi·
dently an error. See Schoem. Opusc. Ac. ΙΙΙ, p. 378.

131. 10. sive vis sive ars slve natura3 a power bestowed by the
gods, a skill gained by observation, or a natural gift. Comp. De Div. Ι,
6, 11 ι duo sunt divinandi genera, quorum alterum artis est, alterum
naturae. The first includes divination from signs, as that by the haruspi-
ces, the augurs, the astrologers and those who divined by means ol the
sortes (see ΙΙΙ, 6, 14 note); the second includes the interpretation oi vis·
iens, the divine inspiration‚ instinctus inflatusque divinus, which last is
in the present passage denoted by vis.

131. 20. ab huiusce terrae continuatione distantium, ie. ab troc ⁸3
orbe terrarum, from the portion of the earth which we inhabit, and which, l
as is said in the following secfion, forms a large island. ‘lhere were
thought to be four of these islands, orbes terrarum, οἰκούμεναι, separated
by the great sea; one inhabited by Europeans and their evvolrrocffi the
second in the same hemisphere, but in the southern half, the inhabitants
of which were called ᾶντοικοι; the third and fourth in the northern and
southern halfof the opposite hemisphere, the inhabitants of which were
called περίοικοι and ἀντίποδες of the Europeans. See Cleomed. I, p. 16
and Bake’s note, p. 291 ff.
