as the Stoic did one must remember that according to Chrysippus, stom
whom this portion of the argument is doubtless directly or indirectly taken,
the thinking faculty resided in the breast, in the beart, and thus close to the
lungs. See Galen, De Hippocr. et Plat. Dogm. Il, 3 sq.‚ and 111, 8. The
thought is formed here as λόγος ἐνδιάθετος and comes forth as speech, lriyar
προφορικός, through the organs of speech.-The Mss. have percipitur
instead ospercietur [the reading in Schoemann's text].

127. 6. finita dantibus can hardly be right. Probably it should be
munita dentibus. See Opusc. Ac. Ill, p. 377.

127. 6. vocem inmoderata profusam, the inarticulate sound; ason
the other hand neoderalio vacis is used in De Leg. 1, 9, 27 for the articula·
tion. By means ot' the articulation are formed the different and definitely
determined sounds, sani uocis distincti et pressi, the characteristic endon·
ment os the μέροπες ἅνθρωποι, by which they are distinguished from the
beasts ol which the vax is immoderate profusa.

127. 13· molles commissuras et artus, “the movable, pliant con·
nectious and joints ”; sor which he might have said commissuras artuum.
Artas are really the same as articuli, Gr. ᾰρθρα, although the word is after·
wards used for the members ol the body ; mallis is originally equivalent to
arabilis, from which it is derived; the meaning “soit” is only a scc-
ondary one.

127. 24. condita. is here more probably from candere than from con·
dire. The salting and especially the conserving, condire, of alimentary
substanccs is usual only to a limited extent3 the laying aside however,
candere, is general; and the most important substances, the grains and
vegetables, need no conserving. Comp. too c. 62, 156 and 63, 157.

127. 25. vesclmur . . . capiendo is an inexactness of expression worth
noticing, for quas capimus, alimus or quae capiuntur, aluntur.

127. 31. [ferrum eligimus3 Mss. elicimus. So in 130. 26 for reme·
dia eligamus the common reading is eliciamus. ln Tusc. ΙΙΙ, § 83 stirpes
aegritudiuis . . . eligendae serni and in ΙΙΙ, § 84 fibrae stirpium . . . eligendae
suut the reading of the Mss. elegendae is now accepted instead of the com·
mon elidendae. ln Div. 11, ξ 149 where the common reading was super-
stitionis slirytes artarier eiciendae Madvig and Baiter adopt eligendae.
Miiller proposes to read elegimus and eligamus in our text; the last is in
lact the reading of lls. Α; the former has no Ms. authority]

127. 32. venas penitus abditas. These words form the second
hals of a trochaic tetrameter, and it is quite possible that not only here but
in De Offic. ΙΙ, 3, 13 Cicero had in mind a passage from some poet. Still
the metre may have been only a matter ol chance. Comp. note c. 9, 253
