BOOK I.-C}1AP. XXIII, XXIV, ξς 62-66. 207

Quo plebiscito decreta a senatu est cousuli quaestio Cn. Caepioni (ann.
613); profectus in exilium Tubulus statim, nec respondere ousus,· erat
enirn res operin.'’ Cic. De Fin. ΙΙ, 16, 54.

51. 6. nupus. Perhaps L. Cornelius Lentulus Lupus, who was con·
sul in the year 579. That he was severely handled by the satirist Lucilius
is shown by Horace Sat. II, 1, 68; and Pers. 1, 1143 of the reason noth-
ing is known.

51. 6. Carbo (C. Papirius), the famous demagogue, and doubtless
the object of attack on the part of the satirist for his demagogical doings.

51. 6. Neptuni filius is equivalent to homo saevus et inzmonis accord·
ing to Gellius, N. A. XV, 21, in allusion to Polyphemus, Cercy0, Sciron,
the Laestrygones and similar monsters which the myth spolie of as sprung
from Neptune. The out of the Mss. is probably not genuine and the
expression denotcs no other than Carb0; for the idea, that the reference
is to some mythical hero, perhaps Cercy0, only deserves to be mentioned
as a curiosity.

51. 14. atomorum . . ‚ltcentia on account of the arbitrary declino· 65
no atomorum, as Epicurus held it. See c. 25, 69.

51.14. quodcumque in solum venit, “whatever comes into your
minds.” The origin of the expression is obscure. See Wolf Litt. Anal.
IV, 347 ff·

51·15· Quae primum nullae sunt, ie. the atoms. The primun
leads one to expect a second proposition in regard to the atoms‚ which
however is wanting; itis clear too that the next sentence does not, as the
enim suggests, give a reason for the non-existence of the atonis. The pas·
suge is incomplete ; and the thought may be conjecturally supplemented
partly from Cicero himself (Acad. 1, 7, 27), as follows: quoe primum
nullae sunl,· nihil est enim [in rerum notura minimum, qnod diuidi
nequeat,· deinde, ut sint, moveri per inane non possunt, siquidem id dicis
inune] quod vacet corpore,· corporibus autem omnis obsidetur locus.
Comp. Schoemann Opusc. Ac. ΙΙΙ, p. 287.-Epicurus assumed as the
beginning of all things an empty space and atoms moving therein. Diog.
L. X, 403 and especially Lucret. Ι, 500 ff. Other philosophers denied
entirely the existence of an empty space. Stobaeus Ecl. Ι, 193 Plut.
Plac. Phil. Ι, 18.

51.18. oraculatundo. See note to c. 16, 42. {g

51. 20. flagitia for opiniones flagitiosos, contemptu et vituperatione
dignas. So also ΙΙΙ, 38, 91. After the statement of these opinions the
thread of the discourse is resumed by hanc tu opinionem.

⁵1· ao. [Democriti. See c. 43, 120 and notet
