BOOK l.-Crntr. XIV, §5 35-37. 195

Or shall we assume that Cicero thought to put a somewhat inappropriate
expression in the mouth of the Epicurean?

43. 23· astris. See ΙΙ, 15.

43. 24 anniti, mensibus &a Evidentlyaperversion, to which Zeno’s
allegorical explanatious of the mythological gods perhaps gave occasion.

43. 25. Hesiodi theogonium interpretatur. Zeno certainly wrote
no particular commentary on the 'l‘heogony, but only referred to itin his
tri-itings on natural philosophy, such as περὶ κόσμου, and explained the
theogonio sables allegorically, per quandam segnificationem as is stated
below, in harmony with his system.

43. 26. usitatas perceptasque. See note to ΙΙ, 39, 91.-cognt.
honoraciores, as below c. 17, 44. ‚

43. 30. Aristonis os Chios, not be confounded with the Peripatetic tt
of the same name from Ceos. We have no other information regarding
bis doctrines, and hence can form no judgment of the correctness of the
statement here made.

43. 33. Cleanthes ol Assus in Lycia, Zeno's successor as head of the
Stoic school.

43. 34. ipsum mundum· Zeno had done the same before. See II,
8, 21.

43. 35. totius naturae monti atque animo, ale. to the soul of the
universe. This is a repetition of the idea os the preceding phrase, sor
the universe is only called God, because it is filled with and animated by
the universal soul. Comp. Varro in August. De Civit. Dei Vll, 6: Hunc
istrum mundum esse deum ,· sed sicut hominem sapientem, cum sit ex cor·
pore el animo, tamen ab animo dici rapientem, ita mundum deum dici ab
animo, quum sit ex animo et corpore.

44. 1. ultlmum . . . ardorem. Also the same thing in another form ;
sor it is the fiery ether that partly encompasses the universe, partly pene·
trates it as its soul.

44, 7, in animi notione.. .rep0nere. Epicurus assumed the ex·
istence of an innate idea, the s0·called πρόληψις, ⁰s G⁰d (⁵ee ⁶· ¹6›43);
a god, to be entitled to our belief, must correspond to this innate idea,
must fit into this mould‚ so to spealr 3 and this is itself the Pf⁰⁰f whether
he is really a god ; just as, is we wished to ascertain whether a f00t were
the one it purported to be, we were to place it in one os its soor-prims, and
judge from the result. Comp. Plato Repubt, p. 462 A: ἄρα ἂ νῦν διῆλθο-
μεν εὶς τὸ τοῦ ἀγαθοῦ lyco( ἡμῖν ἁρμόττει; so also Cicero Orat. c. 38, ¹33²
ea oratio (Demosthenis de Corona) in eam formam, quae est insita in
mentibus nostris, includi sic potest, ut warrior eloquentia non requiratur:
where the idea is also the irame into which the work of art must tit. So
ibid. c. 5, 15. '
