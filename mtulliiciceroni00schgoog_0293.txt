280 NOTES.

exspirantes because this is ordinarily used only oi dying. Respiratus can
only mean in this passage inhaling the air, and so differs from respirare
iu the passages above referred to. The iorm respiratus is found elsewhere
only in Apulei. Met. IV, 15 z parvis respiratui circa nares et oculos datis
jaramins'bus,· where, as is seen, the breathing in general is spoken of, like
the Gr. ἀναπνοὴ. Madvig conjectures intrante spiritu for in respiratu.

[The passage is singularly confused. Dr. Kiihner (Wesen der Gdtter‚
Uebers. ti. Eski, p. 228 note) considers adspiratione aeris in 33, 83 as
clearly meaning the inhalation of the air. Is we suppose Cicero in the
present passage to have stated the sacts correetly, he must mean by adspi-
rantes “exhaling‚’' and by in respiratu “inhaling the air ”3 and if so, he
uses the terms very carelessly. Dr. Kiihner however thinks that he used
the terms in the usual sense, and misunderstood the facts; that is, that he
really thought the lungs contracted by inhalation, and expanded by exhala-
tion. Pros. Schoemann in his second edition seems to think that the terms
are used in the ordinary sense, but that Cicero from mere carelessness says
the contrary oi what he should have said]

before Galen. lt was supposed that the air entered not only the lungs but
the leit chamber os the heart, and passed [rom thence into the arteries.
Galen in a special essay proved that the arteries also contained blood.

from the heart was reiuted by Galen, as an error held by many (among
