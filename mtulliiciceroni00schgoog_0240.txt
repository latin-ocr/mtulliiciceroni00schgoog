os the most remote countries.”] -ΤΙιε following anapaestic verses are per·
haps taken srom the Philoctetus of Attius, and refer to the mysteries ol

the Cabiri at Lemnos. Probably the verses cited by Varro L. L. VII, 11

went before:

Lemnr'a praesto
littora rara et celsa Cabirum
delubra tenes, mysteria queis
pristr'na castr's concepta sacris.

See Hermann opusc. ΙΙΙ, p. rao.

67. 26. Quibus explicatis ive. 'lhat is, the deeds und experiences
ol the gods, set forth in the mysterieS, have an allegorical significatam
il you bring them down to their true meaning (ad rationem revocatis),
you recognize in the gods the powers ol nature personified, and in their
actions and experiences natural events. This was the view ol thinking
minds3 but we cannot believe that the priests themselves gave explana·
tions of that sort to those initiated in the mysteries.—Comp. besides the

similar expressions in regard to the allegorical interpretations of the Stoics
111, 24, 63.

67. 29. hortulos suos inrigavlt, alluding to the garden in whichffl
Epicurus lived. See note on 33, 93.

67. 29. nutare, to waver, have no settled, tenable opinion. Comp.
De Fin.11‚ 2, 6: Nunc aulem dica ipsum Epicurum nescire (quid sit
valuptas) in eaque nutare.

67. 30. Tum enlm censet . . . So far as we can ascertain the theo·
logical views ol Democritus, he held first the existence of a divine sub·
stance pervading the whole universe, consisting of special atoms of the
most subtle constitution. this is the θεία οὐσία in Clem. Alex. Strom. V,
ᾗ 88, p. 698 Pott, and the κόσμου ψυχή in Plutarch Plac. Phil. 1, 7. From
this substance proceed not only the individual gods but also the souls of
living beings, which by breathing constantly receive as nourishment par·
ticles of this same substance which pervades the air. Arist. De Resp. c. 4.
It is this substance doubtless which Cicero here means by principia mentis,
and which above also c. 12, 29 he intends by natura quae imagines fundat.

· For srom this proceed the divine forms called εῑὸωλα on account ol their
subtle, etherial constitution quite different from the coarser corporeal form:
δύσφθαρτα μέν, οὐκ ἄφθαρτα δὲ, καὶ τοὺτων τὰ μὲν εἶναι ὰγαθοποιά, τὰ
δὲ κακοποιά. Sext. Emp. IX, 19, p. 553. 'lbese are Cicero’s animantes
imagines, quae vel prodesse nabis soleant vel nocere ,· and likewise without
doubt the imagines divinitate praeditae mentioned in the beginning of the
passage. But the last-mentioned ingentes imagines, which embrace the
whole universe from without, are not alluded to in this shape by any other
author, and probably are the result oia misunderstanding.
