possessing intelligence and working with the highest skill and wis-
dom. The sum total 01 the universe too is subject to such a force
(81-861 But no one who contemplates the world with its arrange·
ment can doubt that the nature which governs it all is really in the
highest degree intelligent and wise, he will be compelled rather to
recognize a being which manages and governs it wisely (8700).-
The third argument is closely connected with the second, being
based upon the contemplation of the heavens and the heavenly
bodies in their wonderful order, harmony and beauty (91-129);'¹
01 the different plants and beasts constituted and endowed with so
wondrous adaptation (121), of the manifold productioris 01 the
earth conducing to the well-being of various creatures3 and of many
other things of the same sort which are given at great length
(122-132). Cicero omits, however, at the end to draw the definite
conclusion that there must be a divine providence which governs
the world. He assumes rather as a matter of course that all this
is the work of the gods3 and draws simply the conclusion that the
gods could only have created the world for the sake of thinking,
reasoning being5‚ that is, for themselves and for mankind (122);
this is directly followed by the proof 01 the especial care of the gods
for men. The argument consists of a minute description of the
wise arrangement and adaptation of the human body (134-149),
and the facilities it gives men for procuring their pleasures and sat-
isfying their wants (150-152); especial weight is laid upon reason,
which distinguishes man from all other eartlrly beings, and which
enables him to contemplate the heavens and 211210 10 knowledge of
the gods3 from this come piety and 211 the other virtues which
make man so like the gods that they excel him in hardly anything
but immortality. Α11 this cannot possibly be the result of chance.
Balbus here nominally begins the fourth part or the proof that
men enjoy the particular care 01 the gods, although what has just
preceded might with equal propriety have been arranged under
this head. It was, however, so closely connected with the third
part that it was drawn into that portion of ,the discussion. balbus
shows here, 10 addition, that the whole arrangement of the world,
from the heavenly bodies and the succession of the scasons and
weather resulting from their motion t0 the earth with its manifold
products, is evidently intended for the advantage of man (154-162).
Finally the revelation made to men by the various species of divina·
