41. 8. xenophanes, born at Colophon, was banished from there, and
emigrated to the Phocaean colony ol Elea in lower ltaly; he was contem·
porary with the Persian wars and founder of the Eleatic school.

41. 8. mente adiuncta omne praeterea, quod esset infinitum &c
Construed thus the sense must almost necessarily be, that Xenophanes
understood the mens and besides (praeterea) the infinite All as two dif-
ferent things, but still as subsisting in nnion, and that he called them both
together God. ΙΙ Velleius really meant this, it was certainly an error and
in contradiction with what we know ol Xenophanes from other sources.
Ihave therefore taken the liberty to change the traditional punctuation,
writing antire, praeterea quod instead of onrne praeterea, quod dre. Itis
certain that praeterea quod might have been said as equivalent to praeter·
quam quod, though there may be no other example of ir. The sense oi
the passage would then be: that Xenophanes taught that the Omne,
endowed with intelligence, was not only infinite, but was also God. [We
have retained the usual punctuation in the text]

41. ιο. item, ut ceteri, like Thales for example (c. ιο, 25) and
Anaxagoras (c. 11, 26).

41. 11. neque sentiens neque coniunctum. Whatever is infinite
cannot be touched by anything outside os itself, aud hence cannot expe·
rience sensation (see note to § 26) nor stand in connection with any·
thing, because outside of itselr there is nothing.

41. 12. Parmenides of Elea, disciple ol Xenophanes, set forth doc·
trines such as are here cited in the second partos his didactic poem, in
which he treated, not as in the first part περὶ τοῦ ὄντος, ale. of that which
really exists, but περὶ τῶν αἰσθητῶν, of phenomena; and set up a sort oi
scientific dogmatism (τὰ πρὸς dagos). ’

41. 13· coronae simile. ln the world sprung from the elementary
substance Parmenides assumed the existence of a number of concentrie
spheres, which he called στεφάναςε τὴν δὲ μεσοιτάτην ἀπάσαις τοκέα rol
κλῃδοῦχον ἐπονομάζει, δίκην re rol ἀνάγκην, Stobae. Ecl. Ι, p. 482. Comp.
the verse of Parmenides preserved by Simplicius, Phys. Ι, 9 a: ὲν ὁὲ μέσῳ
τοῦτον δαίμων, ὴ πάντα κυβερνᾷ. ln taking the exterior sphere of all for
the abode ol the δαίμων instead ol the middle one Velleius conlounds the
views of Parmenides with those of the Stoics. On this see c. 14, 373 and
comp. Somn. Scip. c. 4.

41. 13. continente ardore, ie. continuo, perpetuo. Comp. Cart. VII,
20, 22 continenti incendio cuncta torrentum-lucis orbem=orbem
lucidum.

41. 16. monstra, also used of fantastic riews, absurdities in 111,17,
443 like portenta, 1, 8, 183 16, 435 and 111, 38, 91.
