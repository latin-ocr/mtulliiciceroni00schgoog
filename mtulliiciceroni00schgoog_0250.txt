clearly. It is not in spite of his real ability, that he has made such an
argument, but because his ability, however great people thought it, was even ·
still greater than the common opinion. The excellence of his argumenta-

tion therefore was to be opposed not to his ability itself, but to the common
opinion of his ability, somewhat thus: quamquam accerrimo esse ingenio
credatur, tamen, quae dicit, eiusmodi runt &e Whether the argumenta·

tion really required so much keenness is another questi0n; however that
may be, it had already been made before Chrysippus by Cleanthes as may

be scen from Sext. Emp. IX, 83.

[According to the preceding note the drift of the sentence would be
that Chrysippus in the argument that follows showed himself to be cleverer ³
than he was generally thought to be. But taking the language as it stands
the opposition would rather seem to be between acerrimo ingenio and ab
ipsa natura,· “although he is a man of very keen mind and so quite able
to construet a perfectly sound and convincing argument, yet the argument
which he actually makes on this point is so sublime that you would think
he had ‘horrowed a leaf from the book of nature,’ and not have found it
out himself.” The point of the remark is then not the greater or less
keenness of Chrysippus, but the soundness and beauty of the argument ;
and in the mouth of a Stoie this seems more natural than a very dubious
compliment to Chrysippus]

83. 20. (a) quo illa conficiuntur. The preposition, wanting in
almost all Mss., is as indispensable here as before domine in the preceding
sentence. Comp. Hand Tursell. Ι, p. 31 f., and below 111, 10, 25 where
the same argument is made in somewhat different language.

83. 26. desipientis adrogantiae. Comp. De Leg.II,7,16= quid
est enim verius, quam nerninem esse oportere tam stulte adrogantem, ut in
se rationem et mentem palat inesse, in caelo mundoque non putet?

83. 29. [A. du Mesnil in Fleckeisen’s Jahrb. 1877, p. 760 proposes
to strike out the noe,- Miiller (Adnotat. Crit.) approves, adding: The
sentence is negligently written; it should run either thus: An. . . possis
adduci, ut putes,· tantum ergo ornatum . . . nonne desipere videare? or
thus ι An . non possis adduci, ut putes ,· tantum ornatum . . . ut tuum
ac nora deorum . . . putes, passis f]

83. 30. et mustelis. The ancients kept weasels as well as cats in 17
their houses for the destruction of mice. Comp. Phaedr. Fab. 1,22; Peri·
gon. on Aelian. V. H. XIV, 4.

83. 34. omnia supera esse meliora. This sentence leads us to
expect a line of argument similar to that in Sextus Emp. IX, 86 ft: namely
that the beings who live in the higher regions of the universe must be of a
higher, superhuman nature, and therefore gods. Instead of this however
