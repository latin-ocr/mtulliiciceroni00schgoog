BOOK IL-Cnue. IV, V, ξς 11-13. 235

tabernaculum was not rite captum,· see Lange, Rdm. Alterth. 1, p. 413.
Now Gracchus, aster the first pitching ol the tabernacnlnm, had occasion
to return to the city; but on repassing the pomerium he forgot to observe
the omens again as required by law; hence the tabernaculum was vitio
captum. Comp. De Div. ΙΙ, 17, 33. — [Schoemann reads [ad] hortos Sci·
pionis] The preposition before hortos is wanting in the Mss.; some
have in hortos, which should then be horto or hortis ,· (in villa Scipionis
is found in Granius Licin, p. 10, ed. Bona). Hortos cannot be taken as
apposition to tabernaculum as has been proposed; it would be better to
strike out the words. [Baiter brackets thern] ,

82. 1. [Senatus ut abdloaret3 for the ellipsis see Roby 1441 and
Madv. Gram. 479.]

82. 13. [Baiter and Schoem. read ars nullo medicinae est t'or the reason
given by Madvig that “it is good Latin to say medicina ars non est, but
not ars nulla, no science.'' Mtiller answers that ars medicina is periectly
good (Varro L. L.‚ V, 933 Quint. XII, 11, 24, rei militaris et rusticae et
medicinae), ie. he takes medicina asan adjective]

8215. nou deorum natura. Numen, and not natura, would be
better in opposition to coniectura. Comp. Schoem. Opusc. Ac. ΙΙΙ, p. 327. y
Itis not meant tlrat Cicero really wrote nuncen,· natura is rather to be
taken in the same sense as in De Div. 1, 49, 110.

82. 16. omnia omnium gentium without any substantive ior omnis,
is also found Ι, 18, 4⁶.- Summa is the sum and substance oi the matter.
Cic. Acad. 11, 9, 29: Non debere eos in suo decreta fluctuare, praesertim
cum in eo summa consisteret ,· De Fin. V, 5, 12: nec in suncma tamen
ipsa aut varietas est ulla aut dissensio ,· Ad Fam. XIII, 75, 2: Summa
est, in quo milri gratificari possis, si curaris, ut Accianus me a te amari
sciat.

82. 17. Innatum, “arisen in the course οἰ natural development,'’ not
“innate”; ior the Stoics did not, any more than the Epicureans, admit the
existence of innate ideas. See above note Ι, 17, 44 and Plut. De Plac.
Phil. IV, 11.

82. 18. cleanthes. See I, 14, 37. With the four following reasons5,

Cleanthes does not mean to give a proper speculative proof of the existence Β

of the gods; but only to show the innasci, the natural origin of the belief
in their existence. l·le therefore says, not argumentis or rationibus, but
causis, ie. occasions, t'or this is the proper idea of the word; hence the
phrase causam capere: and so in ξ 14 when he says tertiam coccsam, quoe
terreret animos sulcccinibus dcc„ the expression is strange, but not exactly
to be condemned. The occasion terrifies a man, in so far as it arises from
the terrining phenomena of nature.
