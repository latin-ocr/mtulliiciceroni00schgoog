188 Notus.v

hence, inasmuch as the spirit, properly so called, can only be the inward
portion, we must conceive the νοῦς as provided with an external body. Α

tt 40. 30. Quod quonlam non planet, scil. Anaxagorae. [Ihereis
here an ellipsis somewhat of this sort: Since Anaxagoras rejects this idea,
he must hold that the mind is aperta simplexque ,· and operta simplex·
que mens dcc. is beyond our power of conception]

40. 31. aperta, ie. nullo corpore cincta. The same idea is contained
in nulla re adiuncta qua sentire possit, because according to Epicurus
sensation is only possible by means of a material body.

40. 32. intellegentiae nostrae vim et notlonemt “this exceeds the
power and faculty of comprehension of our reason.'' The general intelle·
gentiae vim is further defined by notionem, our comprehension.

40. 33. Alcmaeo of Crotona, a younger contemporary of Pythagoras,
by some considered to be of his school. Little is known of his opinions;
whether he really held only the heavenly bodies to be gods, or accepted
other divine existences besides them, is not to be ascertained. [Arist. De
Anima, 1, 2, 17: Φησὶ γὰρ αὐτὴν (τὴν ψυχὴν) ἀθάνατον εἶναι διὰ τὸ ἐοικέναι
τοῖς ἀθανάτοις· τοῦτο δ’ ὑπάρχειν αὐτῇ ὡς ἀεὶ κινουμένῃ· κινεῖσθαι γὰρκαὶ
τὰ θεῖα πάντα συνεχῶς ἀεί, σελήνην, ῆλιον, τοὺς ἀστέρας καὶ τὸν οὐρανὸν
ὅλον]

40. 35. Pythagoras of Samos lived and taught in lower Italy and
died at Croto at avery old age tac. 497.-Nam is here not causal, but
only a particle of transition, as it often is in passing to something which is
to be stated with vivacity and confidence. Itis originally a particle of
asseveration; the causal signification is only a secondary one.

41. 1. antmurn . . . commeantem, ia. a soul of the universe per·
meating and animating everything: πνεῦμα τὸ διὰ παντὸς τοῦ κόσμου διῆκον
ψυχῆς τρόπον, Sext. Empir. adv. Math. IX, 127, not immaterial, but a very
line, fiery ether. Cicero does not expressly say that Pythagoras called
this soul of the universe God; but in this connection it followed asa
matter of course, and hence it is unnecessary to insert deum, before oni·
mum for instance.

41. 2. ex quo nostrl anlml carperentur. Diog. Laer. VIII, 28:
εἶναι δὲ τὴν ψυχὴν ἀπόσπασμα αἰθέρος. Cic. Cat. Mai. 21, 78: Ruthagoras
Pythagoreique numquam dubitarunt, quin ex universa mente divina
delibatos animos haberemus.

σε 41. 6. [autem here introduces another objection, like our “more-
over ”5 it merely continues the argument]

41. 7. nihil nisi anlmus, ι’.ι. entirely incorporeal and immaterial.
But if the soul of the universe was a fiery ether, it was not immaterial,
and the difficulty which Velleius here suggests was unreal.
