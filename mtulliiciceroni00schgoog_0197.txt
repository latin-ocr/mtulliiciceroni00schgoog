to something new, quite different from what precedes, when porro, deinde,
iam aera or the like might have been used instead. Examples in abund·
ance may be found in Goerenz De Legg, p. 47 and Madvig De Fin,
p. 476. — In what went before Velleius was speaking of the revolution of
the universe ; he now passes outo the earth, which does not revolve, but
suffers cold and heat. The reasoning is briefly this: The earth, as part
of the universe, is also a part of God; but the earth is subject to cold and

this is inconsistent with his happiness. Comp. Matthiae, Verm. Schr., p. 54.

40. 1. sle afflelatur [an emendation of Schoemann] for significetur
in the Mss, which nobody has been able to explain, referring to the beat
and cold mentioned immediately after. [Lachmanm Lucret. p. 351, pro·
poses sic incitetur, understanding the passage to refer to what precedes;
but the enim of the next sentence seems to forbid that. Miiller gives the
Mss. reading without emendation]

hopelessly corrupt, the best having: Qualia vero est,· Miiller leaves it
without any attempt at restoration, and Schoemann reads: Qualia vero
(cetera) sint. The reading given in the text is an emendation proposed
by A. Weidner in the Philologus, Vol. 38, 1879. Comp. Tusc. I, 13, 29:
Si vero scrutari velera etex iis ea, quae scriptores Graeciae prodiderunt,

40. 10. [Thales of Miletus, founder of the ionic school, born about
lac. 640, left no writings, but his doctrine, handed down by tradition, was
later committed to writing, for example, by Aristode]

4o. 12. deum autem eam mentem dte. This sounds as if Thales

being along with and distinct from matter, which is doubtless an error.
Thales held that the primal existence was a fiuid which he called bdop;
