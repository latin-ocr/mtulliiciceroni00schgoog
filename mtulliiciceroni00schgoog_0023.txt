10 DE NATURA DEORUM.

more perfect beings‚ of purer etherial substance, without grom
bodies, sinless and wise from the beginning3 these are the gods

(see 11, 13, 35). Considered in this respect the theology of the
Stoics may be characterized as a monotheism and a polytheism
combined. For the one being, whence everything has proceeded,
is alone God in the true sense ol the word, uncreated, imperishable,
and eternal. The other gods are not eternal, but created and per·
ishable beings, that at the universal dissolution os all things will
return into the primaeval being whence they came. F urther, in the
recognition by the Stoics of different sorts of such created gods we
may recognize on the one handa logical deduction from their specu·
lative physics‚ on the other only a concession to the popular saith.
It followed from their physica] views oi the constitution of the lire·
like ether, that they also had to explain the constellations‚ which
consisted ol it, to be gods. But when they accepted gods that
were only deified mortals‚ or gods only as originators and cou-
trollers of certain human relations and moral forces, or as givers of
various gifts, they evidently only followed the popular belief 3 and
so in Cicero's account of their doctrines (II, 23, 60) we do not find, as
in the case of the highest deity and ol the constellations, a demon·
stration of the existence of these gods, but only the simple remark,
that such deities were accepted by wise men not without reason.
The same is the case with the gods which we may designate as
natural spirits, which bear rule in various parts oi the world, the
earth, the sea, the fue, &c The Stoics accepted these too, because
they found the heliel in them among the people, and because they
felt obliged, not to reject, but ratberto recognize a sort oi natural
revelation in the popular faith, so lar as it contained nothing contra·
dictory to reason, nothing plainly false and perverted. But it can-
not be ignored‚ that all these deities occupied an uncertain and am·
biguous position in their system of theology; and if we had fuller
accounts than have actually come down to us of the views ol indi-
vidual StoicS, we should doubtless find not only that they had dif-
fered among themselves on this point, but that the same thinker had
not always consistently held the same opinion. The Stoics were
reproached by their antagonists with believing that the popular gods
were such only in name, not in reality3 partly because they repre-
sented them as created and perishable beingS, and conceded immor·
tality only to the one highest being, whom it is·tme they called
