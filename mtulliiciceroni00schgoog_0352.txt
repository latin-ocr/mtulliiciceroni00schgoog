teriam quandam, ex qua omma expresso atque efficta ,ήκω quae toto
omnia accolere possit, omnibusque nodis ntulari atque ex ortrm' parte dvc.
cf. Plat. Timeo, p. 51 A. This primaeval matter, from which the s0·called
four elements and all other material things proceed but which is itsels
endowed with no definite quality, a ab] ἃποιος, is according to the Stoics
too οὐσία rdw ὄντων ἁπάντων, ἡ πρώτη ὕλη, Diog. L. VII, 150, cf. 137.

166. 28. non aas? [So Baiter and Schoemann. Mliller hasnon 93
[modo] eas,· Madvig proposes Si non eas dre]

166. 29. contemnet. The future indicates that this must be consid-
ered as necessarily following from what precedes.

166. 3¹· iidem dicius . . .11dem vultis :qui dicitis or quamquam
elicitis. . . tamen vultis. By the use os the pronoun of identity in both
members the contrast is all the more emphasized between statements which
are contradictory wn'th each other and which are still both held by the same
persons. Cf. Acad. ΙΙ, 20, 63: qui libi constares, cum idem negares
quicquam certi posse reperiri, idem te ronrperisse diceres. It is more usual
in such oppositions to put the first member in the form ol a relative clause
which is equivalent to a concessive clause, and then in the second member
to designate the person in question, who has been previously indicated by
a demonstrative pronoun or by a substantive, by a demonstrative pronoun
like is or idem, as I, 22, 61; 43, 121.

166. 32· dispertiri...s0mn1a. Cf. De Div. 1, c. 20 sqq.

167. 14. eur 11011 . . . praeficit? ΤῙιε Stoics really maintained this;

but Cotta thinks he has sufficiently shown that it is an error, and so with
this idea asks: “Why is it not so?'’

167. 9. finam. Cf. De Fln. IV, 1, 1: quae cum dixisset, finem illuff

ΙΙ, 6, 17: lum ille, finem, inquit, interrogandi, si videtur.

167.14. pro aris et focis. Both are osten joined together; “for
what is dearest and holiest.’'

¹⁶7· 15. quos . . . sanctos esse dicitis. Plut. Qu. Rom, c. 27² πᾶν
τεῖχος ἀβέβηλον καὶ ἱερὸν νομίζουσι. Injury done to the city walls wasa
capital crime ; and removal os them to enlarge the boundaries of the city
(pomerium proferre) was only allowed with the approval of the gods,
aseertained by the auspicia. '
