SUMMARY.

HE first book opens with a preface addressed to M. Brutus

stating the subject of the present work, noting its importance
in a theoretical and practical way, and calling attention to the great
difference of opinions held upon it by thinkers from the earliest times
(ἐξ 1-5). Cicero then excuses himself for treating a subject of this
sort as against certain persons who had been surprised at his be-
ginning to write upon philosophical subjects so late in life, and
especially at his preference for the Academic philosophy; and he
closes his defence with the very just remark that it is precisely on
the question of the nature of the gods that this endless variety of
opinions would seem to warram the attitudeof the Academics‚ who
gave up anything like dogmatic certainty, and contented themselves
with simple probability (5-14). He passes on then to the narrative
of a supposed conversation upon this matter between Cotta, Vel·
leius and Balbus, at which he was present and which forms the
subject of the following books.

Velleius the Epicurean commences his discourse with a few pre·
liminary remarks against Plato and the Stoice, whose views about
the deity as creator of the world and about the divinity of the uni-
verse he ridicules as absnrd and arbitrary (18-24), and then passes “’·
on to a critical summary of all the opinions advanced from the days
of Thales down to the Stoic Diogenes of Babylon (25-41)¹; a sum·
mary which, however superficial and unsatisfactory as well in the
relation of the opinions themselves as in⁴ the reasons adduced against
