even the most monstrous and most' ridiculous gods (43-50). If
the heavenly bodies are godS, there is no reason for not considering
the rainbOWS, clouds and winds as gods3 if earth and sea pass for
gods, so must rivers and springs3 in short there is no limit (51, 5 ).
The learned inquirers think they have found out that all the chief
gods of the popular belief were only men of olden time who have
not actually become gods but are only imagined to be so by the
deluded people. Such a view, Cotta thinks, must necessarily be
rejected in the interest of religion itself 1; but the Stoics, by
their allegorical explanation of these pretended gods and the stories
about them, have, instead of rejecting them, rather given them a
sort of respectahffity (53-60). Still all their views are easily re· ’
futed. Some of the beings explained to be gods are evidently
impersonal things, qualities and relations; and all the rest after the
Stoic explanations, instead of gods, become mere forces of nature.

N ext came in the original the third part or the refutation of the
proposition that the world is governed by the divine providence3
but the whole of this part is lost.2 A large portion of the
fourth part is also no longer extant, which was devoted to show·

’ ing that the gods had no especial care for men. The remaining
portion (ξ 66) relates to Balbus's eulogy of reason as the
most excellent gift of the gods to men (Bk. ll, c. 61). Cotta

1 For 11115 rejection 01 Euhemerism see note on 23, 60. Cotta is here evi-
dently guilty of an inconsistency. For 1116 1116 16161651 01 religion¹ in order not
to take from the common people the gods in whom they believed, 116 rejected
the Euhemeristic humanizing 01,111616,1116 same interest would necessarily
have deterred him also from interiering with any one of the deities worshipped
by the people which he has really done in many instances in what has pre-
ceded. lt would seem that this inconsistency is due 1ο Cicero alone, and that
the real Academic philosophers by no means disdained to'make use 01 Euhe-
merism as a weapon against the popular religion; just as at a subsequent
period the Christian opponents 01 polytheism were fond of doing. And that
Cicero himself did not refuse to aclrnowledge a justification 101 Euhemerism is
seen from Tusc. Ι, 13, 28, and V, 3, 8.

² We say nothing on the question whether this part was designedly de-
stroyed, because 11 might endanger faith and piety. Arnobius (111, 7) testifies
that 16 reality many even among the heathen were scandalized at this book 01
Cicero's, and thought it ought to be destroyed; and according to Lactantius
(D. 1. 11, 3, 2) Cotta said in the third book: non esse illa vulgato disputanda, ne
susceptas publice relvgiones desputatlo talis exstingueret.
