sions on a given point does not prove that they started from such igno·
rauce, any more than their reachiug identical conclusione would prove
that they started from knowledge. Cicero might properly have said that
the difference of opinions on the subject in question would go sar to show
that the result (not the beginning) oi all philosophy was ignorance; and
hence that the attitude of the Academics was a wise one. Or, it we strike
out causam . . . inscientiam with the que aster prudenter (and this is the
reading of one Ms. according to Ursinus ed. Moser, p. 6), the sense is: that
the difference of opinions on the subject in question goes t'ar to show
that the Academics were wise in withholding assent from things that were
really not to be understood]

32. 8. [prudenter. . .eohlbulsse. The verb in phrases like this is
really contained in the adverb3· “the Academics were prudent in with·
holding their assent '’ &a De Fin. IV, 23, 63: Illi igitur antiqui nan

duction, p. 13.

32. 9. [temeritate here indicates haphazard action, based upon no
rational grounds, in rebus incertis: so temerarlum in the next sentence.
Cf. N. D. II, 32, 82: nulla temeritas, sed orda‚· Div. II, 41, 85: temeritas
et carus, nori ratio nec consilium. Cicero calls it temerarium aut salsum
sentire, aut. . . defendere]

33.1. rem causamque. The more general is defined by the more
special term ; for causa est res quae tabet in se controversiam (De invent.
1, 6, 8).

33. 5. ln summo errore. Error is not always synonymous with the
English “error’'; it often means simply the wavering and uncertaiuty
which comes from ignorance os what is right. Thus errare is osten used
as equivalent to anibigere, incertum esse, as Plaut. Mil. Glor. 111, 1, 197:
erro, quam insistas viam. Senec. Agam. 144: ubi animus errat, opti·
mum est casum sequi. Compare De 0ffic.11, 2, 7: nan sumus ii, quarum
