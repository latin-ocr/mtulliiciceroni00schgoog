although no Stolo, says H. N. VII, prooem: Hominis cansa videtur cuncta

vera est sententia Stoicorum, qui aiunt nostra causa mundum esse con·
structum: omnia enim, quihus constat mundus, ad utilitatem bominis
accommodata snnt; on the other hand Seneca more modestly and rightly
says, De ira ΙΙ, 27 : irinris nos suspicimus, si digni nobis videmur, propter

following phrase quaeque . . . inventa sunt is probably spurious, because
it contains only a gratuitous and jarring repetition oi what was just said;
moreover inventa, which can only refer to discoveries made by man, seems
out oi place here where the discourse turns only on the provident care oi
creative nature-The following proposition in regard to the world as a
state common to gods and men was a iavorite idea with the Stoics, cou-
stantly repeated. See especially Arius in Euseb. pr. Evang. XV, 15: l
κόσμος οἱονεὶ πόλις ἐστὶν ἐκ θεῶν καὶ ἀνθρώπων, τὼν θεῶν μὲν τὴν ἡγεμονίαν

prooi oi the remark immediately preceding iu regard to the regularity
