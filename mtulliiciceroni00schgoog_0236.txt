Orpheus. For the allusion to him enters into the connection of the argu·
ment only on tlre assumption that he is adduced as an example of a vtora-
ens. Comp. Lobeck Agl, p. 349 f. The fact that Orphic doctrines are
several times mentioned in the extant writings of Aristode proves nothing
against the present passage; the name served as a convenient traditional
designation for certain theological views. Tm opinion here mentioned by
Cicero was probably to be found in the Dial. περὶ φιλησοφίας. See Ber-
nays, Dialoge des Arist, p. 96.

6417. hoo Orphicum carmen . . . Cercopls. The Pythagorean
Cercops‚ os whom we have no further information, was thought by some
(for example by Epigenes in arpi τῆς εἰς Ὀρφέα ποιήσεως in Clem. Alex.
Strom. I, p. 397 Pott.) to be the author of two Orphic poems, the
(Θησέως) κατάβασις εὶς arton, and the ἱερὸς λόγος. The latter, often called
in the plural ἱεροὶ λόγοι, consisted of twenty-four rhapsodies and con·
tained a very extended theogony; another, likewisc called ἱερὸς λόγος,
was of ethic and ascetic character. There was also a Cercops from Miletus,
to whom a Hesiodic poem, Aigimius, was attributed; whether he was the
same with the Pythagorean cannot be determined with certainty.

easy to meet from Epicurus’s standpoint; the third is answered by Lucret.

64. 33. Num eadem . . . omnia sempiterna? Epicurus assumed 39

the existence of the infinite quantity of atoms only for the purpose of ex· 1oe

plaining the assumed everlasting efllux of the impressions from the gods.
But Cotta speaks in this passage as if Epicurus intended to prove the
immortality of the gods from the inexhaustible mass of the atoms3 and in
ἐξ 105-107 as is he used the ceaseless efllux of the divine images for the
same purpose. That is certainly an error or an intentional misrepresenta·
tion. Epicurus first assumed the immortality os the gods on account of the
πρόληψις, and then tried to strengthen the belief by appealing to the law
os isonomy. According to this law, in contrast with mortal beings, there
must necessarily be immortal ones; and since all other beings of whom we
have knowledge are mortal and transitory, the gods are the only ones
remaining to whom we either can or must ascribe immortality. Τῇε argu·
ment may be a weal( one; but it is better at any rate than that which Cotta
ascribed to him. For the following objections of Cotta see the note, Sum·
mary‚ p. 26 ff.
