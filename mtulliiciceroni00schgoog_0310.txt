or not to any proposed undertaking; they were supposed, as it is expressed
in De Harusp. Resp. c. 9, to give rerum bene gerendarum auctoritatem,
a guaranty ior the successful issue ; and when the praedictis augurum
are spoken of we are to understand not prophecies oi future events, but
only general assurances os a happy issue, or warnings against disaster.
Aves eventus significant aut adversos aut secundos, De Div. II, 37, 79.
So here providentis to be taken only oi the care on the part oi the augurs

oi the Sibylline books which passed at Rome lor state oracles, those oi ,

gods, a skill gained by observation, or a natural gift Oomp. De Div. I,
6, 112 duo sunt divinandi genera, quorum alterum artis est, alterum
naturae. The first includes divination from signs, as that by the haruspi-
ces, the augurs, the astrologers and those who divined by means oi the
sortes (see III, 6, 14 note); the second includes the interpretation oi vis·
ions, the divine inspiration, instinctus inflatusque divinus, which lastis
in the present passage denoted by vis.

orbe terrarum, from the portion of the earth which we inhabit, and which,
as is said in the following secfion, forms a large island There were

thought to be four oi these islands, orbes terrarum, οὶκοῦμεναι, separated
by the great sea; one inhabited by Europeans and their συνοίκοις the
second in the same hemisphere, but in the southern hali, the inhabitants
of which were called ᾰντοικοι; the third and fourth in the northern and
