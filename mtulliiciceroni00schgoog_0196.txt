connected by ut, stulti nec vitare venientia possint dic, and not in the first
sapientes ea commodorum compensatione leniant ,· this last contains rather
a concession, inserted only for the purpose of bringing out into a stronger
light from the contrast the following clause, the real consequence of ita
multa sunt &c Hence Cicero might have written: ita multa sunt incom-
moda in vita, ut, etsi (or ciem) ea sapientes... leniant, stulti nec vitare
venientia possint necserre praesentia. -This peculiarity of inserting con-
cessions or assumptions without the corresponding conjunctions before
the clause which really contains the essential fact is very frequent in both
of the ancient languages3 and examples may be found in this treatise,
besides those mentioned above, in c. 8, 20; Ι, 26, 743 31, 86; ΙΙ, 34,
873 III, 13, 32. Comp. Hand's Tursell. I, p. 349: Matthiae, Verm. Schn,
p. 52. For Greek examples where the two clauses are distinguished by
μέν and δέ see note to Isaeus‚ p. 195.

39. 27. [animi natura Intellegentia. Schoemann readsz] animi 10
natura et intelligentia, according to the most probable emendation of the
passage which is corrupted in the Mss. Τὴε special designation is added
to the more general by the copula-We shall sec below c. 18, 48 that
the Epicureans held that intelligence could only exist in connection with
the human form.

39. 28. nunc autern hactenus. The adverb can hardly be taken n
with admirabor, which would give no proper sense ; but must be explained
elliptically, supplying some verb like dicam. “So much for the present
ou this point.” Comp. De niv. ΙΙ, 36, 76.

39. 28. admirabor, “I will express my astonishment at.'' Comp. De
Div. Ι, 58, 131: Haec habui de divinatione quae dicerem ,¹ nunc illud
testabordtc.

39. 30. rotundum. This alone is the predicate. The three pre·
ceding adjectives are only qualifications of mundum supplied from the
foregoing sentence. lt seems particularly absurd to the Epicurean that
the animated, immortal and moreover happy universe should be round.
The reason foi· enrphasizing beatum more than the other attributives by
prefixing et eundem will be seen from what follows ; for this revolution of
a round god is in complete contradiction with his pretendedhappiness.

39. 31. Plato, in the limaeas, p. 33 B. Pythagoras held the same
opinion according to Diog. Laert. VIII, 105.

39. 33. ea celeritate contorqueatur. We must bear in mind the
old idea that the earth remains lixed aud all the rest of the universe
revolves around it daily.

39. 35. Quodque. The conjunction que often makes the transition
