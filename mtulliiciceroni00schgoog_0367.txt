111, 17, 43. Tbere is certainly something wanting aiter si di sunt.
Something should follow which could be regarded as an apparent reason
ior the divinity of such beings as the Nymphs, and then be reiuted by
Cotta as not valid proof ; perhaps si di sunt quibus sacrafiunt or the like.

111, 19, 50. It seems to me nearly certain that Leontiwm should be
read sor Leonaticum oi the Mss. In regard to the name Leocorium, 0.
Miiller,1nd.Schol.Gotting. 1840, supposes that it denoted properly a place
appointed for the expiation os the sins of the people (λεωκόρος, after the
analogy oi νεωκόρος); Lobeck, Pathol. 1, p. 550, says: Suspectus est Leos
heros et omnis illa de filiabus eius fabula, sicut omnia quae de Graecorum
sacrificiis humanis tradita sunt. Nomen Leocorion vel Leocori cuiusdam
monumentum est vel populi curiam s. λήιτον significat.

ΙΙΙ, 29, 72. Instead os the Mss. parumne semper in ratione versantur
Baiter reads parumne saepe according to the conjecture of Madvig and
older critics‚ which does not seem to me necessary. Itis clear enough that
parum semper cannot be united ς but parum should be taken with the
following in ratione versantur, whichis required by parumne subtiliter
disputat coming directly aiter. It need not surprise one that it is separated
from it by semper ,· there is a good reason ior the position. Semper points
to the fact that the levitates comicae are not always committed, though they
may often be so, without ratio, without a sort of reasoning to justify them.

ΙΙΙ, 31, 77. Et si verrem est dic. Baiter, after Madvig, reads Utri
verum esset. . ., brackets the words si, qui audierunt to interpretarentur
as a spurious interpolation, and makes the apodosis to the protasis com·
mencing with ut begin in § 78 with sic, ri homines. . . There is no doubt
that Cicero might have written thus, and that it might have been better
had he done so; but it does not seem to me necessary for that reason to
change the traditional reading of the Mss. What is best is not always
genuine, and slight inaccuracies are easier to excuse in a treatise which
evidently affects the freedom of an extemporary conversation. We may
therefore excuse the repetition of the protasis in si, qui audierunt dre,
and the separation os prorsus of the apodosis from its verb tacere. Mad-
vig thought it necessary to change the si verum est to si verum esset be-
cause, according to his conjecture, only these words could form the protasis
to tacere praestaret ,· with the common reading this is unnecessary because
the protasis is contained in the clause si . . . essent discessuri. It is incredihle
that this clause merely repeats in hypothetical form the thought expressed
at the beginning in more positive form by si uerum est &ca-1 have
