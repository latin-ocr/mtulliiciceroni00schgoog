attempts to show on the contrary that reason, since it is so often
turned to evil purposes and brings so much harm, cannot by any
possibility be regarded as a divine gist3 lor we cannot suppose either
that the gods would have given to men a hurtful gift or that they
could not have prevented or soreseen the evil use which mankind
would make of it (66-78). Gods who really wished well to man·
kind ought rather to have made them good and wise3 or if not
this, they ought at least to have had a care for those who are good
and wise (79, 80). But this is no more the case than the other3
the best men often fare the worst‚ and the worst the best; expe·
rience gives no proof whatever osa divine justice, which rewards
virtue and punishes vice; and this would afford encouragement to
crime, were it not for conscience, which, regardless os the deity,
furnishcs to mankind a support and guide (81-85). But no evi-
dence of divine government is discernible here3 and the pretext that
the gods concern themselves with human affairs only in general, not
with trilles, is inadmissible, because the cases in which the absence
of divine justice is felt are by no means all trifles oi no impor-
tance (86). The general belief regards precisely the external
giits of fortune, not the internal ones such as virtue and wisdom‚ as
coming from the gods: and thus the good fortune, which bad men
enjoy, is a proof against the divine government of the world (87,
88). lsolated instanceS, in which the good meet with success are
of no weight against the majority of 'cases where the contrary hap-
pens, ancl it is no excuse to say either that the gods do not concern
themselves with every individual case or that they are ignorant
(89, 90). And to say that the gods visit the punishment of evil
dceds, if not on the evil-doers themselves, at least upon their children
and descendants is to attribute to them the greatest injustice. But
suffering and misfortune come not from any god, but from men
themselves. The deity does not protect us against it, even where
it should justly do so, if, as the Stoics say, it has the power to do
what it wills. So then the deity is ignorant oi what it can do, or it
has no concern for mankind, or it is incapable of judging what is
good (91, 92). The Stoics contradict themselves says Cotta, when
they say that thc gods do not concern themselves with details and
at the same time maintain that dreams come from the gods, and urge
everybody to pray to the deity, for in that case the deity must hear
the prayers of individuals.
