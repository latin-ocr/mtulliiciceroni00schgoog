80. 1. religionum sanctitates=reltgiones sarrcte habitae et obser·
votare. But the assertion that there was a constant improvement in the
matter of religious observances must not be taken too strictly; it is con·

victory which L. AEmilius Paulus gained over Perseus (or Perses) of

Macedonia at Pydna in the year 586.

80. 8. hulus adulescentis. On the pronoun see note I, 28, 79.
