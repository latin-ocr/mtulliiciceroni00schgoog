cessar of the Academic scepticism and the opposition to the dogmatism
of the other schools because of his assertion: That he knew only one
thing, namely, that he knew nothing3 and because of the reasoning he
used to convict of ignorance those who boasted of knowing something.
-Areesilas of Pitane in AEolis B.C. 316-241 went further than Socrates;
for as Cicero says, Acad. 1, 12, 45, negabat esre quidquam quod sciri posset,
ne illud quidem ipsum, quod Socrates sibi reliquisset ,· sic omnia latere in
occulto. -On Carneades see c. 2, 4.

35. 35. ver-l reperiendi causa. The question with them was cer·
tainly one of trutli, although in the end they only arrived at the result
that in the absence of a sure criterion a certain and definite knowledge of
the truth was unattainable and that one must rest satisfied with probability.
De Fin. II, 14, 43: Quasi desperata cognitione certo id sequi volunt, quod
ueri simile videtur. Acad. Il, 3, 7: nihil aliud agunt, nisi utin utrom-
que partem disputando eliciant aliquid, quod aut verum sit aut ad id
quam proxime accedat. Comp. ibid. 24, 76.

36. 9. ludlcandl et adsentiendi nota: acriterion ior judging and
deciding. [Cicero uses several expressions for this, there being no single

probabilia evidently mean that there are many things probable and yet
not certain, which still may furnish to a reasonable man sufficient guides
for his practical actions—Visum, accus. from the verbal subst. visus,
synonymous with visio, properly signifies the mental act of the person
beholding3 it may however be applied to the object which gives rise to
the perception ; as here visum insignem et illustrem lcalere, “ to cause a
definite and clear perception '' (eine destinante und klare Aureliauung
bewirken). [Professor Schoemann here seems to take visum as the act
of perception, and labere in the sense of “ to cause.'' But it would seem
better to take visum: speciem, the sense of the passage being that some
things have an appearance sufficiently clear for practical purposes, though =

...ut ei multa vera videantur, ueqcce tuueen habere insignem illam et
