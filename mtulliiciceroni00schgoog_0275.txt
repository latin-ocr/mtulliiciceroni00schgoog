tt 104. 1. ut Epicurus. Sext. Emp. IX, 333 gives Epicurus's own
words: ἡτῶν ὅλων pior< σώματά ἐστι καὶ κενόν. Comp. Lucret. Ι, 419: ’
Omnis ut est egitur per se natura duabus consistit rebus: nom corpora sunt
et inane—By the following quae his accidant, ie. their accidents, is to
be understood the motion oi the atoms in empty space, and the origin oi
things resulting irom it.

104. 3. natura constare . . . mundum &c The sense is: We mean
that the world is not a mere mechanica] lifeless aggregate like a stone or
a clod oi earth, but a living organie whole like an animal or a plant.

herenee working in it. Natura, lilre dioec, denotes also the ὁὺναμις ivoc-
uonna τοῖς σώμασι, as Galen says Comm. in Hipp. Ep. 6, p. 5 init.; and
Cicero also uses cohaerere in other places oi the organic combination in
one whole. Comp. c. 34, 87; 45, 1153 62,155; Acad. 1, 7, 28: omni
natura cohaerente et continuata; De Leg. 1, 8, 24: alia quibus coliae·

The same author, Ep. 102, calls bodies thus organically cohering continua,
in contrast to the coraposito, those artificially put together by external
means. On this subject Sext. Emp. IX, 78-84 deserves to be consulted.
