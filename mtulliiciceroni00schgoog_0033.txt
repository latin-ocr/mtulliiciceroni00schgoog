opportunity, as public affairs were at the time, for him to engage in
them with dignity and succcsS, and so obtain relief from his sorrow3
and this condition of the state itself for a man like Cicero was no
less a source of sadness, than his own domestic grief.

When we consider these circumstances we are little disposed to
pass a strict judgment on Cicero's philosophical works, but rather
to excuse many undoubted shortcomings inan old man afflicted and
borne down by sadness and care. Even a philosopher by profession
would hardly have been able in such a state of mind and in so short
a time to write satisfactorily upon all the most difficult problems of
philosophy at such length3 how much less a man, who, however
earnestly he had studied these subjects, was really only a dilettante;
and who for the larger and better part of his life had been occupied

volume, and which have given a welcome opportunity to critics fond
of emendations to show their skill. A striking case of this haste is
the leesterno die Il, 29, 73, and titedius tertias ΙΙΙ, 7, 18, as if the
conversation had occupied three days, whereas the beginning of the
second as well as that of the third book represent it as begun and
finished on one and the same day.³ These defects must not how-‚
ever prevent us from a thankful recognition of Cicero's merits even
as a philosophical writer. He was the first to develop the Latin

that case the discourse of Balbus, to which it refe been made on
the day immediately preceding, and not two days
