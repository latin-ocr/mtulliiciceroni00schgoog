data est; quam quad amar civium, nan vis expresserat, nullam babuit in·
vidiam. The same attraction with the demonstrative occurs Sallust Catil.

On Intellegi noluit comp. Ι, 26, 74. '

147. 2. omnem v1m esse igneam. More distinctly expressed it
could have read: omnem vim vitalem esse igneam ,· ior this was the opinion
of the Stoics. See ΙΙ, 9, 23. 24·

³6 147. 7. id . . .‹le calido, i.e. id quod de calida dicitis, commune huic
est cum umore et spiritu ,⁴ or: pariter de umore et spiritu dici potest.

147. 9. animal intrinsecus, the same as ex sese animal which occurs
below, “having life from itsels, an independent existence.’'

147. 10. animam, unde. . monetet animus. It was an ancient and
wide-spread opinion that the soul was aerial and maintained by breathing.
Comp. Tusc. Ι, 1, 19: Animum autem alii animam, ut sere nostri decla·
rant nomine. Nam et agere animant et efflare dicimus. . .,· ipse autem
anintas ab anima dictus est. Further details may be found in Lobeck
Aah, v· 755 ff·

147. 19. ad eundem ettam intertium venire. In the foregoin'g
member Cicero used the subjunctive after necesse est ; it is easy to see why
he now changes to the infinitive. This might be taken to depend on the
foregoing eadem dici possunt, but not so well ; and the change of con·
struction occurs in other passages Comp. Acad. II, 12, 39: ante videri
aliquid quam agamus necesse est, eique quad visum sit, assentiatur, ior
assentiri ,· De Fin. V, 9, 25: rzecesse est finem amnium hunc esse, ut na-
tura expleatur . . .‚ sed extrema illa et summa inter animalium genera
distincta et dispertita sint, sor esse.

147. 24. Eamque causam Cleanthes adfert. This is not men·
tioned elsewhere as the opinion oi Cleanthes, hut agrees very well with that
which Diog. L. VII, 145 ascribes to the Stoics in general, that the suu
draws its nourishment from the great sea. For the great sea separates our
οἰκουμένη from the opposite southern one (see note to II, 66, 164), and lies
itself in the hot zone between the two tmpics, one of which, the Tropic of
Cancer, Cicero here calls the solstitialis orbis, the other, the Tropic of
Capricorn, britanniis-It has been noticed that the words cur ee . . .pr0·

gradiatur form a hexameter. Comp. note on ΙῙ, 60, 151.

147. 26. Hoc totum qualo sit, mox. Balbus had put forth this
view of the nourishment of the heavenly bodies by watery vapours in the
portion of his discourse devoted to the discussion of the divine providence‚
ΙΙ, 45,118. Cotta proposes to postpone his answer until he comesto
consider the same subject. But this part os his argument has been lost.
