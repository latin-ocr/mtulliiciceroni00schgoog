propositions of physics in regard to the creative principle of heat,
the soul of the universe, the divinity of the world and the heaveuly
bodies(18). ·

All that Balbus had said about the nature of the gods is consid·
ered by Cotta as rather adapted to make even their existence doubt·
ful. Balbus had argued that the universe must be God because
there exists nothing more perfect than the universe. But even if
this were true, it does not necessarily follow from its perfectiori that
the universe is endowed witha soul, with reason, with wisdom, nor
that it is God (ar-23). Nor can the regularity of the motions of
the heavenly bodies be cited as proof that they are divine; if so, we
should have to consider the ebb and flow of the tide and even in-
termittant sever as gods by reason of their regular recurrence. The
further deduction of Balbus¹ that, since the universe is not the work
of human power or human wisdom, there must exist beings ofa
higher sort tban men, and hence godS, rests onan arbitrary and erro·
neous view of what is higher‚ and upon a confusion of reason and
natural force (23, 26). That too is a prejudice‚ that the human
reasonable soul must darive from a reasonable soul already existing
in the world. lt is, says Cotta, a result of the force of nature, just

as the harmonious complex of the universe is, and no gods are
necessary to explain this (27, 28).-Next follows the argument of
Carneades, that no bodily‚ no living and sensitive being can be

eternal and immortal (ary-35), and the proof that the principle of fire
or beat, which the Stoics regard as living and as the source of all
life, cannot be immortal, inasmuch as according to their notion it
needs replenishing (35-37).—Cotta omits the further deduction
from this, which follows of itself: for if there is nothing which is
immortal, and if immortality is an essential predicate of the deity,
there can be no gods. Finally he says that the idea of deity ex-
cludes the idea of virtue, which only comports with human relations3
while again on the other band a god is inconceivable without virtue
(38, 39)-

But granting too that the universe is God, how can we justify the
assumption of several gods? And suppose we let pass also the
divinity of the lreavenly bodies3 to consider eatable things as gods
is an evident absurdity; and how gods can be made out of men is
quite inconceivable (40-42). If we arc to learn from popular belief
and tradition whom to recognise as God, we shall have all sorts,
