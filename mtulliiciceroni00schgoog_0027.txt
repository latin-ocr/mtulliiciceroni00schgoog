he also professes in the present book Ι, 5, 10=1²3 reserving at the
same time his right, while giving up the hope of certainty, to hold
the opinion, which might in any case seem the most probable.
We notice that he uses this right at the end of the third book.
While Velleius declares his entire agreement with the simply nega-
tive criticism which Cotta had made of the discourse of Balbus,
Cicero says that for himself the positive views of Balbus seemed the
more probable; and there is no reason to doubt that he thereby
expressed his real opinion. For however much he recognized the
want of scientific rigor in the Stoic dogmatum, and however strong
he found many of the objections made by the Acadernic, his saith
in the existence of higher beings and a divine providence and gov-
ernment of the world was none the less a living one. But it is not
necessary to suppose that all the details of the Stoic system, all the
sorts of gods they accepted, and all that they held in regard to
divine apparitions and revelations were equally a part of his faith.
He held only to the general truth of the existence of divine beings
and the divine government of the world¹ ς and as the Stoics held this
too, their doctrine appears to him for this reason to come nearer to
the truth than the Academic negation‚ which however, as Cotta
plainly enough remarks. is not so much a negation of religion itself
as of the reasoning advanced by the Stoics iu its behalf. The
Academic way of thinking is quite in harmony with a sort of
Eclecticism which seems to have been the only resource for a
heathen of religious and thoughtful mind in a matter like this,
where the limits of human nature make absolute knowledge impos·
sible.

The opinion, held by some, that Cicero has inserted much in the
discourse of Balbus that was gathered not from his Stoic prede·
cessors but from other quartem, seems to be not well founded. It
has been remarked above that various views about the gods and
divine things were found in the Stoic system without regard to con·
sistency3 and it is capable of proof that in fact the most noted
Stoics held conflicting views on many points. Hence there is no
sufficient reason to suppose that Cicero did not really take from
some Stoic or other the whole discourse which he puts into the =
mouth of Balbus. ²
