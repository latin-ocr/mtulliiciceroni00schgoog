BOOK 111.-cun. XXII, XXIII, §§ 54-57. 311

dicebat belongs only to the relative clause and its subject L. Gellius,· and
the authority of all the Mss. and the general connection of the passage
forbid our changing it to dicebant.

153.16. ouius ln tutela Athenas. The allusion is to the Apollo
worshipped by the Athenians as πατρῷος, their tutelary deity ; he was after·
wnrds identified with the Pythian Apollo, theson of Zeus and Leto or La·
tona, but originally was certainly different. See Schoem. Opusc. Ac. I,
324 and 347.

153. 20. Memallo. This name too is doubtless corrupt ς but no certairt
emendation is possible. The islands afterwards mentioned are the Liparaean
or Aeolian, north of Sicily. The name Vulcaniae, Greek 'Hpororrddeg had
perhaps fallen into disuse in Cicero's time ; hence he says rrominobantur.

153. 22. Dlo matre. This is the reading of the best and the greater m
number of Mss, not Dia. Cicero certainly did not find the Latin name of
an agrarian deity in the writings of the Greek theologi whom he here fol·
lows. Serv. note on Aen. I, 297 3 IV, 577, and Ampelius c. 9, agree on
the reading Die. Cf. also below c. 23, 59. The remarks of Wekker,
Griech. Glitterlehre I, 329 in favor of Dia are not to the point.

153. 23. Valentis. Cicero apparently gives this as the translation of
the Greek name Ἰσχυς. According to the fable he was an Arcadian hero,
who won the favor of the Thessalian Coronis, which Apollo had enjoyed
before him. But Ischysis nowhere else mentioned as the father of Tropho-
nius. Cf. Miiller, Orchom, p. 196.

153. 28. [Aegyptum. Lactantius and Baiter 11 write in Aegyptum]

153. 29. Hunc Aegyptil Theuth appellant. Cf. Partheyon Plut.
De Is. et Osir, p. 154 and R. Pietschmann, Hermes Trismegistus (Leipsic,
1875h12r· 29 and 38 sq.

153. 34, cynosuris. The reference is probably either to the Arca· 11
dian mountain Κυνόσουρα, mentioned by Steph. Byz., or to a place in the
district of the Cynuraei, mentioned by Pausanias VIII, 27, 3.

154. 3. Corybantis filius. Apollo is sometimes called son of Cory· 28
basin other places; brit his birth in Crete and his contest with Jupiter for
the island are only mentioned here. As Corybas and the Corybantes orig·
inally belonged to the Phrygian mythology, and were from this adopted by
the Greeks especially in Samothrace and Crete, so this second Apollo owes
his existence donbtless to a combination of Phrygian and Greek fables; his
quarrel with Jupiter may have had reference to the collisions of different
systems of worship. Cf. Hoeck’s Kreta III, p. 146.

154- 5. ex Hyperboren, ie. from the fabled Northern regions beyond
Boreas, where the Delphians themselves were sometimes said to have orig·

inated. Cf. Miiller, Dorier Bk. 11, c. 4.
