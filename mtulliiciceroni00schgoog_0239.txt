sponds to the Stoic definition of εὐσέβεια in Diog. L. VII, 119: εἶναι δὲ
τὴν εὐσέβειαν ἐπιστήμην θεῶν θεραπείας, Comp. Xen. Mem. IV, 6, 4; and
Sext. Emp. IX, 123.- lt is not strange that expressions of this sort hare
no precisely defined meaning, aud hence are not always used and ex·

plained in the same way.

respects worthy of great consideration. The opinion here quoted is also
ascribed to him by Sext Emp. adv. Phys. c. 2, p. 522: Πρόδικος ὁ Κεῖος

119 6717. Euhemero, from Messina in Sicily, at the end of the fourth
century nc, a friend of the Macedonian Cassander ; he wrote a ἱερὰ ὰνο·
ypapn, professedly based on documents which he claimed to have found in
the temple of Zeus Triphylios on an island of the Southern Ocean called
Panchaia ; according to these documents all the gods of the popular belief,
frorn Uranus down, were nothing more than deified kings and heroes of
early times. Extracts from his book are given especially in Diodor. V, 42
ff.; and Euseb. Praep. Evang. Il, 4. Ennius translated it into Latin, and
a number 0f passages of the translation are found in Lactant. Inst. Div. I,
11 ; but their genuineness is doubtful-Homk, Kreta III, 326 ff, and
Gerlach in his Histor. Studien, p. 137 ff, treat of Euhemerus at length.

[But this would require the genitive ultimae to depend on gentes, which
seems rather forced. Why not gentes ultimae ονιινναι, as in Hor. Od. Ι,

extremos? “the most remote people of the countries,’' instead of “ the people
