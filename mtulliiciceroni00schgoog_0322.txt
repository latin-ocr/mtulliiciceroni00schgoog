139. 34. quo haec rogantur. lhe pronoun haec, though not reser-
ring grammatically to caelum, denotes ‘⁶ all tlzese tlirrgs,” in. the universe,
which we unavoidahly think of when we regard the heavens. Comp. ΙΙ,

2, 4 where liner logically includes more than caelum caelestiaque just
preceding.

140. 3. ls'tum potius quam capitolinum. Cotta is quite right here ; 11
the unthinkiug multitude formed their ideas oi the gods from the pictures
and statues they saw about thern, and connected these together in the
closest manner ; so much was this the case, that they in some degree divided
a deity according to the different temples and representations into different
persons, which might even be jealous one of another. It once happened
to the Emperor Augustus (only iu a dream it is true), that the Jupiter
Capitolinus complained of the more zealous adoration which was paid to the
Jupiter Tonans. Suet. Aug. c. 91 ; Dion Cassius LIV, 4; Catull. XIX,
20 represents one Priapus quarrelling with another—Iu quisquam nos·
trum however Cotta without doubt says too much. There were many
people who, although they did not share the views of the philosophers,
did not follow the common multitude ; and who, although conceiving oi
the gods as similar to men and under human forms, still regarded their
proper essenee and their divine power, their ἐνέργεια, numen, not as lim-
ited and confined in these forms, but as pervading a wider sphere accord·
ing to the office and power of each ; they imagined the numen of Jupiter,
for instance, as dwelling in the aether and like this pervading the whole
universe ε τοπικῶς μὲν οὖν πανταχοᾶ) τὸ θεῖον ὑπονοεῖν ἄτοπον · ταῖς μέντοι
ἐνεργείαις πανταχοῦ εῖναι ἀνάγκη, These words of Philoponus (in Lobeck
Agl, p. 913) represent pretty nearly the general view ol thinking people.
