would seem from this passage that they took it from Epicurus. See Diog.
L. VII, 54.

46. 8. The sentence, broken hythe parenthesis, is taken up again by ta
igitur ,· and we should expect, in hannony with what precedes, labere,
parallel with hanc nas labere.

46. 9. [ipsorum deorum; so also Baiter, in. “the existence ol the
gods.” Schoemann has deorum ipsorum]

46. 12. ab Epicuro. In the so-called κυρῖαις δόξαις (see e. 30, 85)
ie. the principal points of his doctrine, preserved by Diog. L. X, 139 ff.
The first of these is: τὸ μακάριον καὶ ἁφθαρτον οὒτε αὐτὸ πράγματα ἔχει obre
ἁλλῳ παρέχει, ὥστε orire ὀργαῖς aire χάρισι συνέχεται· e'v ἀσθενεῖ γὰρ πᾶν τὸ
τοιοῦτον. ’

46. 16. [satis erat dictum. For the indicative in the apodosis see
Madvig Gr. 348, Obs.; Roby, 1533]

46. 18. habet venerationem. So luctum habere (De Leg. 11, 26,
65), delectationem, admirationem, exspectationem, laetitiam, spem, timo·
rem taber-e (Ad Famil. V, 12, 18) and the like are said of things which
give rise to those feelings. Comp. Beier on De offic. Il, 6, 9.—a vi
atque ira goes with metus,- as metuere ab aliqua, “ to be afraid of a per-

46. 27. ne omnia revocentur ad primas notiones, “ not to explain
everything by reference to primary ideas.¹’ The primary ideas are the

πρόληψις by γνῶσις a κατάληψις (Theodoret. Therap, p. 42 Gaisfi). Cotta
exposes the weakness of the argument c. 32, 89. 90.

46. 30. eandem equivalent to item, as Brut. 84, 290: Non omnes qni 47
Attice, iidem bene dicunt. See Reisig, § 2105 Mad. Gr. 488.

46. 33. Vos quidem, Lucili, soletis &a 3 Balbus too does so in II,
4ff.

62: Namque Carneades concertationis studio arcada hac modo illua’ ait ,· Ad
