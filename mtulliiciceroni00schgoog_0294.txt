would not have 'continued quoe . . . constituit, but qui constituerunt. Per·
haps he really wrote ab ea, i.e. a naturae providentia.

124. 9. humo excitatos &a Comp. De Leg. l, 9, 26: nam cum
ceteras animantes (natura) abiecisset ad pastum, salunt boniinem erexit,
ad caelique quasi cognationis domiciliique pristini conspectum excitavit.

124. 11. exterra homines exterra, standing at the beginning,
properly goes with spectatores in the second member which Cicero had in
mind on commencing the sentence, though he inserted sor the sake ol
contrast the negative member, non ut incolae. ·

124. 19. [in] sublime3 see note c. 16, 44.—iud1cium magnum 141
earum est, “their judgment is ol great importance.” Comp. c. 58,
1463 De Orat. 111, 59, 222: oculorum magna est moderatio, is ol great
significance.

124. 26. omnesque mInimos . . . adpulsus, “all, even the slight-
est impressious.'’ Comp. above Ι, 24, 67: omnibns minimis temporum

ullo minimo momento.

Set lubricos oculos fecit corresponds to the first primum ,· firmos autem to
the second. The use of primum twice in this way is a sault which might
have been avoided with more care.

124. 34. ut continerentur. lt isa little doubtful what the subject
of this verb is, oculi or membranae. It comes however to the same thing;
ior the membranae, which Cicero means, are the exterior parts of the eye
itself‚ the cornea. By means of its hardness and stillness it maintains its
form (continetur) so as not to be dispersed or put out of place.

125. r. pupula, also pupillo, the pupil, Gr. κόρη, of the picture which
is represented iu it; ἐν ᾤ τὸ εῖδωλον ἀντιλάμπει τοῦ βλέποντος, Plutarch De
Fac. in Orb. Lun. c. 27.

125· 8. et somno coniventibus etc. The reading of the Mss. in this 14³
passage contains so gross a violation of grammatical construction that it is
difficult to believe that Cicero really wrote it so. After coniventibus,
whether taken as abl. abs. or dat, a clause ought to follow with some other
subject than oculi ,· such is not the case, but instead os it comes utque

have it; it must have crept in through an oversight. But the copyists,
misled by the preceding apertis, have written corriventibus instead of coni·

necessary subject to quiescerent. In the intervening sentence quam . ..
