would have been more correct. See however note to c. 22, 61. For the
subject-matter comp. II, 33, 84 and Ps. Plutarch De Plac. Phil. I, 9:

τὴν ὓλην. Bouhier has proposed manerent instead 01 manarent 011 110·
0011111 ofterram,· which is of course inadmissible. Heindorf’s suggestion
is better; ut aquam et a'e‘ra .· tum solem, lunam, sidera, terram 810. The
words qua omnia continerentur are superfluous, probably an old addition
suggested by omnia continentem above.

are lost in the universal nature, those of the better sort maintain a per·
sonal existence and lead a godlike life until the general conflagration 01
all things ; a few 01 especial excellence are taken into the number of the
gods. See Il, 24, 62 and Ps. Plutarch De Plac. Phil. IV, 75 Diog. 1.

44. 31. Neptunum. See 11, 26, 66 and 28, 71. Perhaps aether
would have been more correct than a‘e'r, but the Epicurean is not quite so
exact. The author of the Herculanean fragment col. 3, 2 (p. 80 Gomp.)
uses ἀέρα even 01 Zeus ; and 8, 3 (p. 85) he calls the Stoic gods ἀέρας καὶ
πνεύματα καὶ αἱθὲρας, Moreover Empedocles did not strictly distinguish
the two expressions. See Karsten, Emped, p. 217; and further in Schnei-
der, Callimach. 1, p. 293; and Munro's note on Lucretius II, 1115.

and was also said to have written a poem on the theogony. All the cita·

Seleucia in Syria, καλοῦμενος δὲ Βαβυλώνιος διὰ τὴν γειτωνίαν, as Diog. L.
