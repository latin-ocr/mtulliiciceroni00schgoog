505. Cicero mentions a temple consecrated by him to Spes, De Leg. ΙΙ,

Liv. Ι, 21.

97. 11. a M. (Claudio) Marcello 3 in the second Punic war. Q. Maxi·
ntus, next mentioned, is the famous Fabius Cunctator who conquered the
Ligurians in 521.—non has probably fallen out before multia· forthere
was at the most an interval of twenty-nine years between fabius Maximus
and hl. Marcellus.

97.1b. Voluptatis. ΤΙΙε customary name in worship was Volupia‚'

{24 97. 26. hune Liberum Semela natum, ie. the Greek Dionysus, to
whom the name of the old Italic god Liber was transferred on account of
certain resemblanees. But Dionysus, at least as Cicero thought, wasa

Riim. ily-th, p. 440 ff. ‚

97. 27. Libera, also an old Italic goddess, like her mother Ceres;
both were afterwards identified with Greek goddesses, Persephone and
Demeter—The mysteries here referred to are doubtless the Eleusinian,
in which Dionysus (lacchos) was worshipped along with Demeter and
Persephone or Kore; but this mystic Dionysus seemed so different from
the mythical son of Semele that Cicero had no hesitation in explaining him
to be the sanie with the old ltalic Liber.

97. 30. in Libero non item3 i.e. whereas Libera is universally con·
sidered the daughter of Ceres, and the name is explained from that circum·
stance‚ Liber does not pass for the son of Ceres. - But whose son he was
considered to be we do not know.

63 98. 2. induti speeie humana, tle. the fact 'that these divine beings,
which are really nothing but forces of Nature, were not only personifred¹
but were conceived of in human form, gave occasion to the mythological
sables of the poets.

64 98. 9. id est igneam. The Stoic adds this to indicate how the view

of the ancients is to be understood in conformity with the doctrines of his

school.
