296 . uerus.

18 14¹· 35. illa etiam differemus. ΤΙιο plural is used because the
pronoun relers not only to quod Chrysippum dicere aiebas, bnt to the more
remote quae . . . comparabas, ct cum . . ‚adserebas Comp. 11, 50, 1263
59, 147. Tne words quae in domo pulchra cum pulchriludine mundi com·
parabas are to be taken as a shorter expression for quae in domo pulchra
cum pulchritudine mundi comparanda! dicebas: lor taken literally they
would not agree with what Balbus had said Il, 6, 17, and with what Cotta
would be likely to say-Before the following oum . . . adferebas one
must supply ol course quae dicebas.

142. 7. physice. Comp. Ι, 27, 77 and ΙΙ, 18, 48. Here too there isa
little irony, for the physics ol the Stoics amounted to very little lor an
Academic.

14²· 10. curn dooere velles deoe esse, ie. in that part of your dis-
course where you attempted to prove the existence of the gods. The fol-
lowing words, quare et mundus dre, are to be taken with quaen te nudius
tertius dicta sunt, “the reasons which yon adduced to show that the uni-
verse &c was endowed with leeling and mind.’'-For nudius tertius see

Introd, p. ao.

8 142. 19. sed ab hac ea quaestione . . . separentur3 ie. the com-

19 plete proof os the reality ol divination falls under another head3 in the

investigation ol the existence and nature of the gods it is taken for
granted.

142. 29· Modo possemus euru animantem oogltare. This is not to
be construed with the preceding dicebas and nen dubitabas, as il Cotta
meant to represent itas having been said by Balbus3 lor Balbus did not
make this a condition; he merely deduced the animation ol the world
as anecessary consequence from the proposition that it was the best and
most perfect os everything. Cotta now objects to this deductiori, that it
involves something inconceivable. Before Meda possemus we must supply
something like recte, or non intercederem or the like. For mado see Hand
Tursell. III, p. 638.

142. 30. cogitare vel potius . ..cernere One can think, cogitare
in the wider sense ol the word, os all sorts os things, even of phantoms; bnt
we can really perceive, eernere, only what is true and actually existing.

21 142. 34. nullo modo prorsus lor prorsus nullo modo. The adverb
strengthens the negation, the negation does not negative the adverb. So
prorsus strengthening the negation is placed after non in De Fin. ΙΙ, 5, 17:
Nan prorsus, inquil: “not at all,'’ not, “not quite.'' Comp. Madvig’s
note. So with the ordinary non omnino, whereas omnino non is more
rare, So in Greek osten, ob πάνυ, aba dyav.
