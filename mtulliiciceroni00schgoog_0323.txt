140. 13. Homerus . . . recens ab illorum aetate. The Tyndari·
dae were, as brothers of Helen and Clytemnestra, contemporaries of the
Greeks who fought before Troy, although they died before the war in the
flower of youth. Homer was thought by many, as by Krates and his fol·
lowers, to have lived immediately after the Trojan war; see Procl. Chres-
tom. in Becker’s edition of the Scholia to the Iliad, p. r. But Cicero in
another passage (De Republ. ΙΙ, 10, 18) cites the opposite opinion of
others, according to which Homer lived about thirty years before the Spar·

Olympiad, ie. 885 ; and in Tuscul. V, 3, 7 he makes Homer and Lycurgus
contemporaries. The reason of his attributing the other view to Cotta is
easily seen. The passage of Homer alluded to is ll. 111, 243.
