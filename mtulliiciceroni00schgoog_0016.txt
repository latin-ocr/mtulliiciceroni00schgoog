means of supplying this clesect satisfactorily¹3 a few general remarks ι
however, for which there was no room in the notes, may not be out
of place here.

The earliest speculation ol the Greeks, if it deserves the name, on
the origin ol the world and the forces that formed it coincides at least
partially with the ideas which we tind more or less plainly indicated
in the oldest poetry of Homer and Hesiod. The primaeval water of
Thales may he recognized in the Homeric Oceanus the origin of all
things3 and the primaeval air of Anaximenes may correspond to
the Hesiodic Chaos.'² But the popular religion of the Greeks left
the origin of things quite out of consideration3 and, taking for
granted the existence of the universe andos the gods insisted only
upon reverence to the gods as exercising the government of the
world and presiding over human life, each in his own sphere and
office. No one of the older philosophers thought it necessary to
contradict this faith in general, although they might not have been
led to it by their own speculations. They either lest it to stand
upon its own ments, or felt its intluence so strongly as to recognize
it, and so to keep religion and speculation separate. Although they
criticised certain popular and mythological conceptions‚ and some·
times incurred opposition and persecution for so doing,³ yet on the
whole we hear very little of any aggressive contradiction on their
part, or even of remarks implying indifference or disparagement.
The reason is, that as there were no religious dogmas or doctrine
authorizedandprotected hythe state or the priesthood, the ritual
worship was the only thing established and inviolable; this simply

1 It is only necessary to compare the writings ol the best known investigators
os the history ol ancient philosophy to see how the scanty and unrcliable state-
ments of later writers, which arc our only source ol knowledge, have been
differently understood and explained by one or another; so that the pretended
results are not unfrequently very wide apart in the most important points: while
very little remains that is generally accepted as true. For this reason it has
been thought best not to refer in this commentary to any particular historian of
ancient philosophy as a reliable gulde.
