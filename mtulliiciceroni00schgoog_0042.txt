believe in any gods, but only made a pretence of doing so, in
order to avoid unpopularity (120-124).

This is the summary of the first hook3 a few observations on the
Academic's criticism of the theology of Epicurus have been already
made in the notes; but it may not be amiss to weigh it a little more
carefully. Any person possessing a moderate acquaintance with the
history os ancient philosophy and the contests of the various schools
knows that the fighting was not always done with fair weapons‚ but
that misrepresentation and unjust deductions from the adversaries*
propositions were not uncommon. There is no want of this in
Cotta's discourse. We must recognize the reproach as well founded
that the Epicurean theology undermined and destroyed all religion
worthy of the name; and when Epicurus notwithstanding this talked
os pious reverence lor the gods because of their essentia] excellence,
we may at least doubt whether he was really in earnest. So far as
we can see from the remains of his writings or those ol his followers,
the idea os εὐσέβεια was limited simply to a belief in the immor·
tality and perfect happiness of the gods and the rejection of all
such conceptions as were inconsistent with it; and these included
not only the mythological fables and many perverted and contra·
dictory notions ol the common crowd. but the teachings of other
philosophers as well, who ascribed to the gods the government of

the world and a care for earthly and human affairs; for Epicurus ⁴

thought that this would give the gods an occupation so troublesome,
burdensome and vexatious, that such a thing as happiness would be
lor them impossible. lf the Epicureans did not entirely withdraw
from the traditional rites of religion, they did so chiefly in order to
give no offence‚ which might perhaps have brought them into dan·
ger (Plutarch, Non pessundatam etc, c. 21) ; they did not disdain
even to hold the priestly offiees (Lucian, conviv. s. Lapith., c. 9) 3 ζ,
and it is quite credible, as Cicero assures us (e. 30, 8 5), that many
of them, however free-thinking they may have been iu theory, were
yet in practice exceedingly superstitious. Similar contradictions be·
tween theory and practice have always been common in this matter.¹

1 In regard to Epicurus personally we may confidently assume that in spite
oi all breaking away from religion in his philosophica} speculations he still had
a leaning to it at heart, for there are many signs of it in his letters and in
