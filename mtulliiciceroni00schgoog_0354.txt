Introduction, page 9. We are justified in ascribing personality to the
original deity of the Stoics because he is endowed with consciousness, will
and wisdom; and we cannot conceive these attributes as existing indepen-
dently of a personal being. Eut tbe Stoic deity is not on the one band
simply immanent in the universe, like that of a one-sided pantheism3 nor
on the other a blind natural force, the uncomprehended force ol atheism:
he pervades the world, but is not lost in it and still remains exalted above
it. of course there is no question of an absolute personality in the case
of this deity, partly above the world, partly immanent in it, in fact the two
ideas of the personal and the absolute are irreconcilable ; and the longer
we meditate on the nature and attributes of the deity⁸ the more surely shall
we come to the conclusion ol Arnobius whose words are cited in the note
to 111, 15, 38.

'l'hnt the Stoics were unable to conceive os the deity as a purely imma·
terial being will perhaps not seem unpardonable even to those who hold
the opposite opinion ; and so much the less will they be blamed sor con·
ceiving os the matter of the divine being as ether, the source of light and
beat, since they were neither the first to hold such a view, nor have there
been wanting even in recent times menos the greatest honesty and relig·
ious feeling who thought as they did.

Introit, pp. 11, 12. In Book II, 6, 16 the Stoic says: Etenim si dinan
sunt, quid esse polest in rerum natura homine melius? in ea enim sola est
ratio, qua nihil potest esse praestantius. Esse autem hominem, qui nihil
in aneni arundo melius esse quom se putet, descpienlis adrogantiae est,-
ergo est aliquid melius ,· est r'gitm proserta dercs. The Stoics rightly thought
it incredible that in this world emanated from the original deity man should
be the only being endowed with reason except the heavenly bodies, the
simple aspect ot' which seemed to show their etherial nature, and their won-
derful and regular movements to prove their intelligence. They found
in the popular religion a belief in the existence ol uther beings ot a

higher gracie than man, although they conlaudassent tu tne conceptam
