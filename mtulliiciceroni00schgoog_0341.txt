312 noras.

154. 7. Νόμων. Apollo shares this surname with Hermes. Arist.
Thesm. V. 977. It really means however not the lawgiver‚ as Cicero and
others explain it, but the god of the pastures and flocks ; and Ἀπόλλων
νόμως is properly, so far as the idea is concerned, the same with Aristaeus
mentioned in c. 18, 45 as the son of Apollo. Cf. Pind. Pyth. IX, 65 (115).
The form Nomionem of the Mss. is only an error of the copyists.

⁵8 154. ro. Upis as the name of a male deity only occurs here. Itis
often found as a surname of Diana, where it is regarded as a collateral
form of ὁπις, dare, and explained as referring to the oversight of the actions
of men and to the punishment of their transgressions. ’

15412. Dionysos multos. It is extraordinary that just here the
Dionysus of the commonmythology, son of Zeus and Semele, is passed
over. Those that are mentioned all belong either 10 the Orphic or other
fables unknown to us. -On the unetenues see Schoem. Griech. Alterth.
11³, p. 50²·

59 15417. [Elide. Eli Mss. and Baiter II.]

154. 23. orta Nilo. The Aegyptian Neithis meant, commonly iden·
tified with Minerva ; although others call her not the daughter of Nilus,
but of Zeus (Diod. I, 13), orof Hermes (Plut. De Is. et Osir, c. 7). Ac·
cording however to Jablonski, Panth. A. Ι, p. 168, Nilus is just the same
as Zeus.

154. 24. [a love. Schoemann omits the preposition]

154. 25. Coryphe probably owes her origin 10 later mythologists, who
explained the story of the birth of Minerva from the head (ἐκ repentae) of
Zeus by substituting a nymph, Coryphe, for the head. Cf. Schoem. Opusc.
Ac. Il, p. 163.—For the following, daughter of Pallas, see Tzetz. on
Lycophr. v. 355, and hliiller Kl. Schr. II, p. 135.

oo 154, 32. quibus intellegis resistendum esse. When Cotta in this
passage, as also in c. 21, 53 speaks against Euhemerism, he does so solely
in the interest of religion, of which in several passages Ι, 22, 61 and 623
ΙΙΙ, 2, 5. 6 he has avowed himself a devoted adherent. lle wishes there·
fore that the popular deitics should be considered not only as rnen who
have been wrongly deified‚ but as really gods. As an Academic he could
attach no importance to this 3 he must on the contrary have considered the
fablcs about the gods as reprehensihle in so far as they were believed to
be real histories of the gods ; and Euhemerisnr‚ which 10011 ground against
this belief and considered them merely as accounts of the actions of rnen,
must have rather seerned 10 him cornmendable. -Cotta might however
blame the Stoics 110111 both points of view, because instead of setting them
aside they appeared by explaining thern allegorically to bring them to a
certain extent into credit again. - Instead of aliaque eiusmodi the Mss.
