noos< 111.-cm.v1‚v11, §t 12-16. 295

Cotta’s answer is lost; the portion that remains goes to prove that divina-
tion, evenis it were any thing more than a figment of the brain, would still
be of no use tomen, because what was destined to hoppen would happen
at any rate and could not be avoided by knowing it beforehand. This
argument is also found De Div. II, 8, 20.

141.1. id esse fatum. Comp. note on 1, 20, 55. Chrysippus’s defi·
nition in Eusebius Pr. Ev. VI, 7, 13 runs thus: τὸ ἀπαράβατον καὶ ἐξ αἰῶνος
καθῆκον τῶν αἰτιῶν, ὅσα οὑτωσὶ κατηναγκάσθε γενέσθαι, καὶ ὃσα ἄλλως ἔχειν
κεκώλυται.

141. 4. fissum iecoris: probably a fissure or cut separating the dif-
serent lobes of the liver, called limes in Seneca OEd. 365. The fissure
denoted good or evil fortune according to the circumstances; there was a
fissum vitale, a fissum familiare, and other similar sorts. See De Div. ΙΙ,
6, 12.13; Brisson. De Form. 1, 31; Miiller Etrusk. II, 182.

141. 4. sortls, such as were used in the temple of Fortuna at Prae·
neste for divination; they were counters, which when mixed like a pack
of cards were thrown into a vase, and one or more were drawn out.
Hense the expressions sortes aequore, sortem ducere or trahere. Comp.
De Div. 1, 18, 343 ΙΙ, 33, 703 41, 96; Suet. Tiber. 14. The sortes were
not all of the same kind, and those expressions do not have the same mean·
ing with all.

141. 10. Deciorum devotionibus. See 11, 3, ro. 1⁵

141. 11. [eorum refers to deos in the preceding sentence; iniquitas
is unfairness, injustice.]

141. 18. Faunus omnino quid sltnesclo; ae. as a philosopher, and
especially of the Academy, he does not know it ; as pontifex of course he
knows what the Faunus is, at least he knows what invocations and prayers
are to be directed to him, what manifestations of power are to be expected
from him, what sanctuaries and feasts are sacred to him ; on all this con·
sult the citations of Merkel on Ovid. Fast. Prolegg, p. CCII. For nam as
a particle of transitiou see note on c. 24, 61.

141. 22. formatas for informatas, more common in this sense, which 17⁰
was also used above 11, 5‚13.-The following repetition of the reasons
adduced by Cleanthes changes the order there followed, putting the third
before the second ; evidently because Cotta after answering the argument
from divination wishes now to treat only the third, that drawn from the
wonderful and awe-inspiring phenomena of nature, leaving the second and
fourth for a later part of the discourse when he means to speak of the
divine providence, the same arguments being applicabis tobotn. Re tous
avoids repeating the same thing as Balbus duo. 'ibat portion ot Cosas

discourse is however lost.
