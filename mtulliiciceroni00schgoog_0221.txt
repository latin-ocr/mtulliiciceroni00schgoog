51. 20. leucippi. “plenum et inane dixit esse, unde omnia gigne·
rentur.” Cic. Acad. 11, 37, 118. The plenum, παμπληθές, was an infinity
of infinitely small invisible and indivisible particles, στερεά, ἀδιαίρετα, dass
ρα τὸ πλῆθος καὶ ἀόρατα διὰ σμικρότητα τῶν ὄγκων. Arist. De Gen. et Corr.
I, 8. -Leucippus was however but very little older than Democritus.

ατ 51· 29. Quldenlm mereas‘? “ What could induce you (what would
you take) to give up being an Epicurean ?’' Comp. De Fin. 11, 22, 74:

Quid enim mereri velis . . . quid merearis igitur, ut dicas te orinia volup·
tatis causa facturum? Verr. IV, 60, 135: quid arbitramini Rheginos
aserere uelle ut ab iis nrarmorea illa Venus auferatur?

52. 2. nulla moderante natura. This contradicts what Velleius
said above, c. 20, 53. But in a certain degree both are true. The atoms
in moviug perpendicularly downward plainly obey a law of nature; but
they vary from tlris direction without a specific law, and it is only by virtue
of this variation that the origin of the world is possible. See note to c.
25, 69.

68 52. 8. ut tu paulo ante3 above c. 8, 20.

5211. in dumeta conrlpltis. The simile is taken from game hard
pursued and flying into the thick wood where the hunter cannot easily fol·
low; so the Epicureans recur to propositions that are unintelligible and
hence hard to controvert. This is shown in the following chapter by two
examples, which are foreign to the main subject; thatis taken up again
inc. 26, 73·

52. 19. nihil fore ln nostra potestate. Inasmuch as the soul also
consists of atoms, if the atoms had no power of varying from the course
prescribed by the law of nature, all the activities of the mind must follow
the law of nature, and free will would be excluded. For this reason Epi·
curus conceded to the atoms a certain power of voluntary motion, which
enabled him, he thought, to explain by the concurrence of the atoms thus
varying from the perpendicular line both the origin of the universe and
the freedom of the human will. Comp. Cic. De Fato, c. ro, ²²3 and
especially Lucret. 11, 217 ff. and 251 ff.

52. 21. quod Democritum fugerat, because Democritus had
assumed not a perpendicular motion with a voluntary deviation, buta
whirliug motion inherent in the nature of the atoms and taking place of
necessity. Diog. L. IX, 45 : πάντα τε κατ’ ἀνάγκην γενέσθαι τῆς δίνηςαὶτίας
olon( τῆς γενέσεως πάντων, riv ἀνάγκην λέγει. See De Fin. Ι, 6, 18.

70 52. 25, aut etlam aut non, “either Yes or No.'’ Compare De Fato,
c. 10, 21 ; and Acad. ΙΙ, 30, 97 where the same thing is said of Epicurus;
and for etiam for affirmation see Heindorfs note to Hor. Sat 11, 3, 97.
