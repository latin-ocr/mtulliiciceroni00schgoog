have atque or et eiusmodi, so that eiusmodi would stand ior the subject,
which is quite contrary to usage.

155. 2. Nam mentem. We must supply some phrase like: idemque ἓξ
de reliquis dicendum est, to which nam relates, inasmuch as it clearly does
not introduce the reason oi the proposition immediately preceding. It is
here rather a particle of transition; and the usage is in such cases to be
explained by supplying an intermediate clause in conformity with the con-
text. So above c. 6, 15 ; ior further details see Hand Tursell. ΙΙΙ, 147.

155. 4. in nobismet insunt ipsis. Cf. the explanation in ΙΙ, 23, 61
and the note. Iu regard to honos, salus and victoria the Stoic might
have offered an auswer, and ior Fortuna he would perhaps have said that
what appeared to men as inconstantia and teneritas was not really such,
but only an ἀνθρωπίνῳ λογισμῷ briola αἰτία, according to Piut. De Plac.
Phil. 1, 29 and Stobaeus Ecl. Ι, p. 218.

155. 15. inisse sapientes videantur. Cf. I, 15, 41. 62

15516. quod miserandum sit, laboratis=laborem, qne¹ mise·
randns sit, suscipitis.

155. 20. Quid Veiovi facies? Festus answers this, p. 379: Ve syl-
labam rei parvae praeponebant, unde Veioaem parvum lovem. Oi the
correctness oi the answer we will say nothing3 but we see from Ovid Fast.
III, 445 that by Veioais many people understood a small, youthiul Jupiter.
-The etymology oi Volcanus is louud in isidorus p. 1026, 32 Goth:
dictus Volcanus quasi volans candor, vel quasi volicanus, quod per obrem
volet, which is at the least uo worse than the most of those given by Bal·
bus Π, 25-27, or than a recent one, which derives the name from the
Greek, 'Oluaioe=“dragging the foot,'’ because of his lameness. Com-
parative philology refers the name to a Sanscrit root alba, oalka, which
means “hurning.’'

155. 23. natare visus es=flnctuare, move hither and thither with-
out sure footing, titubare, “to be all adrift.'’ ef. Horat. Sat. 11, 7, 6:
Pars multa natat, modo recta capessens, interdum pravis obnoxia.

155. 29. figuras deorum: divine forms, in which the gods are eru· 63

bodied and live.

155. 30. Qui tantus error furt. “The error of deifying natural ob-25¹
jects went so far.''—The deification of Febris Cicero mentions and dis-
approves in De Leg. Ι, 11, 28, but speaks only oi an altorff, so in regard to
nara hortuna. orbona is mentioned sy rutulum Au. Nat. 11, 15 as
a goddess, quae in obbitatem semina extinguat. But in that passage the

Mss. have Orbana.
