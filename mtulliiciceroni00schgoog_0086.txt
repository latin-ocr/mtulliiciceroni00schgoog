10111 01 the chief forms 01 matter, the so-called four elements‚ earth, ,f-
water, air and fire. Hence heat is to be regarded as the living
principle of the whole universe (25-28). But this principle must
be conceived as possessing consciousness and reason. For since
there exists in all not simple, but composite natural bodies a supe·
rior governing power (ἡγεμονικόν), to which all the rest are subor-
dinate, so there must be a superior governing power in the uni-
verse 3 and since some subordinate parts 01 the universe are endowed
with reason, the superior parts must also be so endowed3 hence the
universe and this all-pervading‚ all-animating principle must be
endowed with reason, and the universe, since it is penetrated and
animated by this principle, must be a being endowed with reason,
divine and possessing in full divine power (29, 30). This principle
is then, as has been said, heat,¹ buta heat much purer‚ much more

elements, earth, water and air, yet exists independently 01 thern 35 quarto pars
mundi or as a fourth element in the oetier (1 ²7)- The common earthly lire,
liic noster iguis, quem usus uitae requirit, confector cousumptorque oninium
(141), appears on the contrary not as a separate clement, but only as a varia·
tion or inferior 101111 01 1110 other. According to Cicero then three grades are
to be distinguished 01 this genus igneum: first, the ardor caelestis, qui ricther
vel caelum nominatur (i41)·, second, the vital heat in anirnals and plants,
iguis corporeus (141), 01 liic noster calor, quo haec quae nota nobis sunt retinen-
tur et vigent (130); third, the common frre which only burns, destroys, dis-
solves, confector, et consumptor omnium (141). In other authors, as Stobaeus,
Ecl. l, 36, p. 538, only two sorts are distinguished, trip τεχνικόν and rip dre χνον,
the latter being common 1110,11101ο1111011110 tivo other sorts which Cicero dis-
tinguishes‚ which in 1301 possess in common the animating and preserving
power. The Peripatetics blamed the Stoics 101 using the one term rriyi 01 the
heavenly ether and 01 common fire, though others had done the 531110 before
them; they themselves rather regarded the ether as a separate existence, a
fifth element in addition to the tour common ones. See Cic. Acad. l, 11, 39:
Ps. Arist. de mund. c. 2, 5, with the citations 01 Kapp, p. 28; and ideler‚ note
011 Α1151, Μο1001. l, p. 335. When, moreover‚ the Stoics laid down the propo·
sition that no tire can exist without replenishing as universnlly valid, so that it
might be applied to the original tire irom which att things have proceeded,
they certainly laid themselves open to the attacks os their opponents: and we
find that the Academic in Bk. lIl, 14, 37, makes use 01 this to prove that the
original fire (or the primaeval deity of the Stoies) cannot lie eternal. We must
suppose that the Stoics really limited the proposition only 10 the varieties 01
