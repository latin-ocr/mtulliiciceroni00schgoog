found at the end of the Summary of the first book.

The Stoics maintained a very different attitude towards the popu·
lar belief 3 toa certain degree at least they undertool( to support
jand defend it. They distinguished at the outset a threefold the·

r ology: the political, the mythical or poetical, and the philosophical

or physical.¹ By the first they understood the religious ordinances
recognized in the various states, and placed under the control os the
public authority3 that is, the traditional or legally established regu·
lations about the deities to be worshipped in the state, and the
manner of paying this worship. The second head comprised the
sables recounted by the poets of the gods and their doings. So
sar as these pretended to be narratives oi actual events, they were
entirely rejected by the Stoics as being equally destitute of external
or internal truth3 that is, they neither contained any basis of fact,
nor were they in harmony with the nature os the gods. Of course
they thought they discovered a kernel of truth in many sable8‚ a
physical or ethical proposition under a mythical form, but certainly
not in all, and they disapproved in general of the mythical form of
treatment of these subjecta because few persons understood it, and
the majority were misled by it into false and perverted conceptions
of the gods. They thought, however, to find the key to the under-
standing of the most important fables in the third part, the physical
or philosophie theology; this not only undertook to prove in gen·
eral the existence oi divine beings and a divine order and govern-
ment of the world, but also recognized the deities proposed by the
political theology as objects of worship3 and although not repre·
senting this recognition as necessary, it at least sought to justify
it as reasonable and probable. As the chief heads of this physical
theology of the Stoics are contained in Cicero's second book, and
are grouped together in the Summary of that book, we may refer to
that for the details, adding however here a few observations.
- Itis customary to call the theology of the Stoics pantherinm and

as coextensive with and pervading all its parts. The deity of the
