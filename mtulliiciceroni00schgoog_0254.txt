regarded as a substance in the physics of the Stoics; and natura in its
concrete signification comprises every natural substance; further on the
earth is called terrena natura.

86. 18. terram fumare calentem. These words form the last half 25
of a hexameter. Itis hardly to be supposed that Cicero would quote a
line of poetry for so unimportant an observation; it occurred to him by
chance. In Orat. c. 56, 189 he remarks how easily this may happen, and
many collections have been made of examples from the best writers.

Temperatio is the right measure, the proper degree of heat‚ as above c. 5,
13 caeli temperatione. Of course ea does not belong to temperatione but
is accusative and repeats the idea of the subject ; as c. 9, ²4 id vivit, and
§27 ea etipsa.

86. 27. fusio is the property of water, when it is not confined, to
spread on all sides. The expression serves therefore to defiue further the
preceding, liquor. The Mss. have effusio without et. Instead of deinde
