although no Stoic, says H. N. VII, prooem: Hominis cama videtur cuncta
alia genuisse natura ,· and the Christian Lactantius, De Ira Dei, c. 14, says:
vera est sententia Stoicorum, qui aiunt nostra causa muudum esse can·
structum· omnia etaim, quibus constat mundus, ad utilitatem hominis
accommodata suut,· on the other hand Seneca more modestly and rightly
sayS, De Ira Il, 27 : iiinzis nos suspicimus, si digni nobis videmur, propter
quos tanta aramentum. [Comp. Montaigne, Fascis, Liv. 11, c. η]

62 128. 28. deorum hominumque causa. Comp. above c. 6, 16. The
following phrase quaeque . . . inventa sunt is probably spurious, because
it contains only a gratuitous and jarring repetition ot' what was just said3
moreover inmuta, which can only refer to discoveries made by man, seems
out ol place here where the discourse turns only on the provident care oi
creative nature-The following proposition in regard to the world as a =
state common to gods and men was a iavorite idea with the Stolos, con·
stantly repeated. See especially Arius in Euseb. pr. Evang. XV, 15 ι l
κόσμος οἱονεὶ πόλις ἐστὶν ἐκ θεῶν καὶ ἀνθρώπων, τῶν θεῶν μὲν τὴν ἡγεμονίαν
ἑχόντων, τῶν δ’ ἀνθρώπων ὑποτεταγμένων· κοινωνίαν δ’ ὑπάρχειν πρὸς dilel-
λονς διὰ τὸ λόγουμετέχειν, ὅς ἐστι φύσει νόμος. Comp. Cic. De Leg. 1, 7,
23; De Fin. ΙΙΙ, 19, 64. In the Hereulanean Fragment Col. IV, 22 it is
ascribed to Chrysippus, in the third book περὶ plosor.

155 129. 2. ad mundi cohaerentiam. See note to c. 32, 82.—tamen
et spectaculum . ..is not for etiam spectaculum, but points to some·
thing which Cicero was about to add in opposition but afterwards sorgot,
or at least does not bring in the corresponding form. He might have said:
et magnam lautitiam vitae utilitatem afferunt .· eorum enim cursus dinte-
tati &c As it is, this last proposition, introduced by euim, follows as a
prool os the remark immediately preceding in. regard to the regularity
and ingenious adaptation observable in the movements ol the heavenly
bodies. lor it is just this which has made it possible for mankind to
measure time rightly—The words ad ratlonem sollertiamque prae.
stantior· are not to bc interpreted by supplying incitandam, as if the
question were ol arousing the tellection and incentive power of man
by the observation of the heavenly bodies. Praestans ad aliquam rem
means: “excellent in regard to (on account of) something''; as in De
Leg. ll, 13, 33 : inulta ad veritatem autorizabilia: “ prophecies wonder·
iul in regard to their truthsulness’'; Pro Fontei. 15 z vir ad usum et dis.
ciplinam peritus, (ια’ casum fortunamque salix .· “an experienced man as
regards practice and knowledge,a lucky one as regards chance and ior·
tune.’'-On insatIabllior see note c. 39, 98.
