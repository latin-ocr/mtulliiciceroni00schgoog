172 noras.

The Latin seems to have had no single word to express the vegetable king·
dom. Cicero uses several circumlocutions ; ΙΙ, 33, 83: eaquae a terra
stirpibus continentur,· 11,10,28= ea quorum stirpes terra continentur ‚·
De Fin. IV, 5, 13: res eae quae gignuntur e terra ,· N. D. ΙΙ, 13, 36: stirpes
alone; Sallust Jug. 70, 6: gignentia. See Niigelshach, Lateinische Stilis·
tik,§ 36, 1, 2.]

33. 29. quae dicentur 111 hle llbrls. See ΙΙ, 62, 156 seqq—ea
ipsa, these things exactly as they are.

33. 30. fabricati patine, i.e. paene fabrili opera fierine, with
artistic plan and care.

33. 31. Carneades of Cyrene, head ol the Academy at Athens about
the middle of the second century rac. His negative critssism, on which it
may suffice sor the moment to referto c. 5, 11, was directed especially
against the Stoics and their leader Chrysippus. Compare also ΙΙ, 65, 162
and ΙΙΙ, 17, 44. He wrote nothing except some letters to the Cappadocian
king Ariarthes, but his lectores were reported by listeners and published.

33. 31. lta goes with disseruit, not with multa,· it points to the char·
aeter os his arguments, which were such ut excitaret (sc. Carneades)
homines dac. For the arrangement ol the words compare Verr. Il, 3, 8:
magistratuum nostrorum iniurias ita multorum tulerunt, ut numquam
ante hoc ternpus ad aram legum . . . confugerint.

341. Qua quidem ln causa. The idea may be better defined by
mentally supplying tractanda. Cicero says: While undertaking this dis·
cussion Ι um quite in a position to defend myself srorn any one who
blames me for it.-lt is entirely erroneous to refer this expression, as
many have done, to the Stoics and Epicureans.

34. 2. [benivolos. So Miiller writes here, and in 1, 21, 58; 44, 122
from the Mss. Both bene· and beni· are correct, but the former became
the recognized form from the first century of the empire. Brambach.]

346. [brevi tempore edidimus. See Introduction, p. 19.]

34. 10. eam . . . philosophiam, i.e. Academicum. In Acad. 11, 19,
61 Cicero represents Lucullus as saying to him: Tune eam philosophiam
sequere, quae confundit vera eum falsis, spoliat nos iudicio, privat oppro-
batione, ominibus orbat sensibust-The dative rebus is not to be taken
with lucem eriperet on account of the order ol the words; we might rather
supply a dative like nobis or lronzinibus. Compare Acad. Il, 10, 30: quid
eum fortiorum putem de abditis rebus et obscuris, qui lucem eripere conetur?
ibid. 32, 105: uon euim lucem eripimus: sedeo, qeiae vos percipi, eodem
nos uideri dicimus,· and 103: ab Academia seusus eripi. Compare Liv. X,
32: nebula erat-densa adeo, ut lucis usrim eriperet.
