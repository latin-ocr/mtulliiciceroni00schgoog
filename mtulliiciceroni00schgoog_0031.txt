years older than Cicero, was one of those who were accused of
maiestatis under the Lex Varia (see note on ΙΙΙ, 33, 81). He went
into exile, but returned to Rome with Sulla in 672, where he was
made pontifex and consul in 679. ln the latter office he carried a
lere tribunicia: ut tribunis plebis liceret postea ulcus maghlralus
capere, quod lcgc Sullae iis erat ademptum. Ascon. in Cornel, p. 78
Or. After'his consulate he went to Gaul and succeeded in estab-
lishingaclaim to the honor of a triumph, which was granted him;
he did not live to enjoy it, but died a few days before it was to hap·
pen. Asconio Pison., p. 14. He is very highly spoken of not
only for a most exact knowledge of philosophy, but also as an ora-
tor, and even when a young man he had made a bold defence in
court of Rutilius, his maternal uncle (see note on ΙΙΙ, 32, 80). He
was plainly in every respect a fitting representative of Cicero, who
takes for himself in the conversation only the part of aquiet listener.

Cicero represents these three men as assembled on one occasion
during the Latin feast at the house of Cotta, probably in one of his
villas-and as giving their various views about the nature of the
gods in a conversation, where he was himself present, as he hap-
pened to be visiting Cotta at the time. The date of this sup·
posed conversation must be placed between the year 679, the year
'of Cotta's consulship, and 676, in which Cicero returned from a
prolonged absence in Greece, where he had busied himself particu-
larly with philosophie studies3 and these are alluded to doubtless in
Ι, 6, ¹5·

The book opens with a dedication to M. Junius Brutus, after·
wards the murderer of Caesar, a man whose finished philosophica!
culture and writings are often mentioned with the greatest deference
by Cicero, who was himself twenty-one years his senior. Excellens
eueni genere leudr's, he says of him in Acad. l, 3, 12, sie philosophiam
Lotiru's litteris persequitur, nihil ut iisdem derebus Graecia deucere.
He professed the doctrines of the Academy of Antiochus, for which
the note tol 3, 6maybe consulted. We have none of his work:
remaining, but Seneca, Consol. ad Helv c 9, quotesa short passage
from his book De Virtute, andin epist. 95 something from thet
περι καθηκοντος (de ccffiffl) but Quintilian, X, Ι, 123, saysihatin Ι
