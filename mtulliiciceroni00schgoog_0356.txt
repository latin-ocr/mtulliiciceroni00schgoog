they seem to make no difference between these two, unless it be that the
second denotes especially the beings nearest to man 3 just as man's reason·
able soul is often called the demon that dwells in him. This whole class
of subordinate beings appears in general to be employed in the service os
the supreme being, filled with the divine Logos, and hence friendly dis·
posed to men ; men have a dimmer and less vivid consciousness of the
divine Logos, which needs quiclrening and strengthening; and in this they
are aided by these interior beings, who act as mediators between them and
the highest God‚ with whom direct communication seems to be hardly con·
ceivable. In this sense Antoninus IX, 4o recommends men to pray to the
gods for moral light and strength3 Zeus, that is the supreme being, says
Epictetus, Diss. Ι, 14, 12, has given to every man his demon to watch over
him. Man, says he (III, 24, 60), must strive to be on friendly terms with
the gods, he must be mindful that he is related to them (l, 9, 11 and 23),
and hence must try to be like them. These teachings are really only another
formos expression for the highest moral law ὁμολογουμένως τῇ diruet ζῆνυ
for it is the higher nature of man that is here in question, which manifests
inell as the divine Logos in the reason and conscience, and constitutes his
relationship with the gods. Τῷ λογικῷ ζώῳ η’ αὑτὴ πρᾶξις κατὰ φύσιν ἐστὶ καὶ
κατὰ λόγον. Antonin. VII, 11. ’
The ethical doctrines os the Stoics have thus an essentially religious
character, though not a theological one; the theological portion is limited
to a very few simple propositione, which would rather recommend than
injure them in the eyes of many. Not to enter more fully into the subject
a single point may be mentioned, which has been noticed by Simplicius in
his commentary to Epictetus, Euchir, p. 8. He says: καὶ τοῦτο δ’ dv τις
τῶν λθγωνποθτων θαυμάσειεν, ὃτι τοὺς πειθομένους καὶ ἐργαζομένους τὰ λογό-
greve μακαρίους ἀποτελοῦσι καὶ εὐδαίμονος, οὐδὲν δεηθέντες τὰς μετὰ θάνατον
τῆς ὁρετῆς ιἰμοιβὰς ἐπαγγέλλεσθαι, κᾶν πάντως ἀκολουθῶσιν καὶ οὗτοι. And
so it really is; Epictetus never refers to a reward to be expected after
death. Although the Stoics never denied the continuing existence of the
seul after death, many of them having expressly professed their belief in it,

yet they never presumed to speak of a future judgment, of punishment of
the wicked and os rewards for the righteous. of course they thus surren-

dered a motive for well doing, which may be the most powerful for the

majority of people, and which for this reason cannot be abandoned ina
eatechetical instruction intended for the multitude.
