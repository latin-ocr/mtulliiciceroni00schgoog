145. 14. nullum est eorum, referring to the preceding omne animal,
equivalent to anestia animalia,a constructio adsensum. So in De Fin. IV,
20, 57: cunique omnis controversia aut de re soleat auide nominasse,
utraque earum nascitur tic. -On patibilis see note on II, 39, 98. Cicero
uses it in passive sense, Tusc. IV, 23, 51 3 but not elsewhere.

145. 16. et si omne animal tale est, ie. serendi etpatiendr' necessi·
tati obnoxium. This sentence with the conclusion drawn from it is for
the moment put in hypothetical form, to be repeated afterwards with atqui
in a positive form ; and the mortality, the divisibility and the destructibility
of all living things then follow as a matter of course. - Moreover in this
series of propositions the first, si nullum eorpus inmortale sit δια, seems to
be superfluous in so far that no especial application is made of it to the
mortality of the animalia ,· if there had been, it must have been put in be·
tween the first and second proposition, somewhat in this way: ergo cum
nullum animal sit nisi corporeum, consequitur etiam animal nullum in·
mortale esse. But Cotta might omit this as a thing to be taken for granted.

145. 17. Ergo itidem. Ergo seems to imply that the divisibility is a
consequence of the serendi et patiendi necessitas just mentioned, which
would hardly be granted without qualification ς ergo then would have been
better left out. Τὴε opinion of some, that ergo may be equivalent to deinde,
is properly rejected. See Hand Tursell. ΙΙ, p. 464.-The following sen·
tence would be better omitted as it only repeats what has just been said.

30 145. 24· similiter igitur. This igiturjoins the conclusion with the
preceding protasis introduced by si. So below ξ 33. Comp. De Invent.
I, 34, 69 ε quodsi melius gubernantur ea, quae consilio, quam quae sine
consilio administrantur, nihil autern artensium rerum melius administra·
tur quarn onrrris mundus ,· consilio igitur niureo'us administratur.

145. 24. omnia [quae sunt]‚ equibus cuncto constant. If Ci-
cero really wrote thus, sunt cannot be taken as thc uerbum existentiae and
as a complete predicate ; for in that case omnia quae sunt would mean
“ all that exists,'' which is plainly not intended here; sunt must therefore
be taken as the copula, and the sense must be omnia quae sunt cuncto·
rum elemento. But the strange form of expression is a very improbable
one ; Cicero probably wrote: si omnia,e quibus, quae sunt, cuncta con-
stant ,· or the words quae sunt should be erased.

145. ²9· Etenim omne corpus . . . ‘lhis sentence does not give the

reason of what immediately precedes, but that of the proposition: muta·
bilia sunt omnia.
