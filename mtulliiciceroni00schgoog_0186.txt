34. 12. desertaeque disciplinae. See below c. 5, 11. Antiochus,
mentioned just below, is to be regarded as a desertor of the Academy.
3419. Diodotus, a Stoic, lived ior several years in Cicero’s house

and len him a considerable property at his death.
34. 19. Philo oi Larissa, an Academic, fied during the Mithridatic war
in 666 from Athens to Rome, where Cicero, as he himself says Brut. 89,

306, totum se ei tradidit. He was the last representative of any note oi
the Academic philosophy. Philone vivo patrocinium Academiae non
defuit says Cic. Acad. 11, 6, 17.

3419. Antiochus of Ascalon, a disciple oi Philo, but not his suc·
cessor. He abandoned the Academic scepticism and devised ior himself
an eclectic, dogmatic system composed of Platonic, Aristotelio and Stoic
tenets taken together. Comp. Acad. 11, 22, 69; and especially Madvig,
Preface to Cic. De Fin, p. 61, ff. ο

34. 20. Posidonius os Apamea in Syria, disciple of the Rhodian
Panaetius, the most distinguished oi the Stoics at that time. He lived and
taught mostly at Rhodes and is hence called Rhodian, but also passed
some time at Rome. All that remains oi his numerous writings in frag-

ments and citations may be iound in Posidonii reliquiae doctrinae. Coll.
atque illustr. J. Bake. Lugd. B. 1810. 8.

34 25· Nemeum oblatae. See Introduction, p. 20. 4

34. 29. ad deeus et ad laudem civitatis. Comp. De Div. 11, 2, 52 ⁷
magnificum illud etiam Romanisque hominibus gloriosum, ut Graecis a'e
philosophia litteris non egeant.

34. 31· multorum-scribendi studia. Comp. De Offic. 11, 1, 2. 8
No notice has come down to us oi the many whom Cicero here speaks oi.
We know indeed that several oi his contemporaries wrote in Latin on
philosophical topics, ior example P. Nigidius Figulus and M. Terentius
Varro, not to speak oi the poet Lucretius ; but they were not induced to
do so by Cicero's example any more than the Epicureans¹ Amafinius,
Rabirius and Catius, whom he mentions disparagingly. Acad. 1, 1, 5 ;
Tusc. IV, 3, 6 ; Ad Famil. XV, 16, 1; 19, 1. Perhaps however Brutus
and Plancus mentioned by Quintilian X, 1, 123 and C. Asinius Pollio were
among those whom he has in mind.

35. 2. vinceremur, not vincamur. The imperfect limits the re·
mark to Cicero’s previous writings, and the sense is simply that he suc·
ceeded in not falling behind his Graecian models in adequate expression
oi philosophie ideas. In another place with patriotic enthusiasm he main·
tains broadly Latinam lingnam non modo non inopem, ut vergo putant,
sed locupletiorem etiam essequam Graecam, De Fin. 1, 3, ιο, comp. 111,
