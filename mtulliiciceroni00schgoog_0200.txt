note to c. 12, 30) ; but only in so far as we consider it certain that Anax-
agoras really understood the νοῦς to consist not only of finer and purer
matter than everything else, but as actually immaterial. But is this really
so sure?

motum aud compares Arist. Phys. Ausc. VIII, 1: φησὶ γὰρ (ὀ Ἂν.) ὁμοῦ

4ο. 25· motum sensui iunctum et continentem, “activity pro·
ducing motion (bavegende led'tigkeit) bound up and going together with
sensation and consciousness” (sor sensus includes both these ideas).
That the activity ol mind is attended with sensation and cousciousuess fol-
lows, without being especially stated, from the fact that ratio, reason,is
ascribed to it. But according to Epicurus not only is an activity of any·
thing infinite and incorporeal which worlrs upon matter and sets it in
motion impossible, because only matter can work upon matter, but any
sensation is impossible, because this too can only result from the aetion
oi matter upon manen-In the following words: neque sensum omnino,
quo non ipsa natura pulsa sentiret, it is hardly correct to take ipsa natura
as nominative and only another expression sor injinimm. It is rather an
ablative absolute. Cicero says that sensation would be inconceivable such
as we should have to assume under the supposition os an infinite incorpo··
real spirit, namely that it would perceive without its nature receiving aa
impression from without (natura non pulsi). Ipsius would be a better
reading than ipsa-[This passage is very obscure, and the explanation
turns upon Cicero’s understanding of Anaxagoras's doctrine. He seems
to have thought that Anaxagoras held that the νοῦς was immanent in
and coextensive with the universe3 and then makes the Epicurean object
that there can be no motion and sensation combined in what is infinite,
nor any sensation at all unless nature itseli experiences such sensation.
There can be no motion and sensation in the infinite because, as the Epi·
curean thought, motion and sensation cannot exist sine corpore, the Deity
must according to them be endowed with a corpus ora quasi corpus ,⁰
and there can be no sensation at all ol the mens infinita, if that be imma·
nent in and coextensive with the universe, because sensation must result
from some external cause, and there can be no such cause externat to the
whole universe. Comp. p. 41, 11 and Schoemann's note]

4o. 28. sl mentem istam quasi aalmal. Epicurus considered
two things essential to the animal; an inward portion, the animo, from s
which comes the name, and an outward portion, the body. Now ii the
νοῦς ol Anaxagoras is an animal, it must be likewise so constituted; and
