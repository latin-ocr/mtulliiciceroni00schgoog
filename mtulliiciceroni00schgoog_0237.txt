⁶5· 3. sint quae . . . conservent ; [Schoemann reads sunt &c.]. 'ibe
opponent is speaking.

65. 4. ea conservent, quae sunt. The sense is: there may certainly
be certain preserving forces ; but they can only preserve what really exists.
But Ι do not believe that your gods really exist.

65. ro. et deus vester. As this is opposed to the soregoing, sed might
have been used; but all languages sometimes use the simple copula when
the opposition is not to be made especially prominent. Cic. De Leg. ll,
21, 53: troc vero nihil ad pontificium ius, ete medio est iure civili. Other
examples in Hand Tursel. II, p. 495.

65. 11. ne beatus quidemr “and rnoreover not happy ”2 simply
continuative, not cumulative, as in cases where ne. . . quidem = not even.
Comp. III, 17, 43; 26, 68 ; and more in Madvig Cic. De Fin. note, p. 816.

65.17. quos non pudeat. The Mss. omit the negative, so that the
sense would be: The other Epicureans arc ashamed of their master3 you
alone do not share in this. It is unneccssary to note the improbability of '
sacha compliment to Velleius in the mouth of Cotta.

65. 20. persequitur omnis nominatim, ior example in the περὶ
ritune, of which a passage, quoted by Athenaeus VII, p. 280 A, is trans·
lated by Cicero, Tusc. ΙΙΙ, 18, 41: Nec equidem habeoquod intellegam
bonurn illud, detraheris eas voluptates, quae sapore percipiuntur, detrahens
eas, quae arrditu et cantibus, detrahens ras ettam, quae ex formis percipi-
untur crudiatuum uratr'ours, siue quae aliae voluptates in toto troruiue
gignuntur* quolibet seusu. But Cicero has omitted in the translation the
portion to which the censure contained in obscoenis especially applies, uic
δι’ ἀφροδισίων ἡδονάς, quae si appellationes praefandus sit he says De
Fin. 11, 10, 29.

65. 28. At has leviores ‹lueis3 an objection which Cotta himself
makes in behalf ol Epicurus in order to controvert it directly3 just as in
c. 41 init: Atdrlare vacant. —Epicurus was osten reproached with incon·
sistency in his tcachings in regartl to plcasure3 while in many passages he
represented the pleasurcs oi the senses as the highest good, at other times
he disparaged these and exalted the pleasures of the mind. Comp. Tusc.
Ill, 20, 46. The following quormque ludis? hints that he could not have
been really in earnest.

65. 29. titillatio. Epicurus said γαργαλισμός and γαργαλίζειν, Athen.
XII, 546 E; Plutarch, Non posse snav. vivi, c. 3 and others. Cicero,
translating the words in other passages by titillari and titillatio (De Fin.
1, 11, 39; Tusc. ΙΙΙ, 20, 47; De Offic. ΙΙ, 18, 63; Cat. Mai. 14, 4),always
adds a quasi to quality the inappropriate expression.
