stantive itself, oculis, in its place may be compared with similar examples
such as are given in c. 9, 25 note.

[This passage is quoted by Isidorus, Etymolog. XI, 39 ed. Migne‚ and
runs thus: Muuz'tae suul autem (palpebrae) vallo capillarum, ut et aper·
lis aculis, si quid inciderit, repellatur, et samua construentibus, tanquam
involuti quiescant latentes. In our text we have changed † utqui of Miu-
ler and the Mss. to ut ii‚—tahing the sense of the passage to be this:

¹²5· 17. nequid intrare possit, sl pateret. The elliptical expres·
sion might be supplemented by quodfieret or fieri posset, si pateret. So
Geli. V, 19: tam lure legeque filius siet, quaen si ex eo patre uatus esset,
ie. quarn esset filius, si . . . Comp. Kiihner on Tusc. V, 33, 96.

125. 24. his naturis = relus leuius naturae.

125. 25. testudine . .. aut cornu. In stringed instrumente the
strings are stretched sometimes over a hollow body, testudo, asin the case
of the cillere (guitur), sometimes between two hollow arms, as iu the
case of the lyra. These were called cernua. See ἓ 149.

12 5. 35. multa cernunt subtilius, sc. quam bestiae. The compara·
tive is used in all languages in such away that for the other side of the
comparison one must supply not a positive, buta negative. See Nitzsch ou
Plato's lon, p. 66. llere we must supplement subtilius quam bestiae, quae
ue'lu'l subtiliter cernunt.

126. 1. tum venustatem. The tum is awlrward, because there is no
corresponding lum afterwards and it cannot be taken as correlative to
the preceding primum, unless with Hand Turseli. I, p. 766 we strilre out
the words colorum etiam el figurarum as a spurious addition. Perhaps
some old reader wrote on the margin lum for the following alque, and
copyists afterwards inserted it in the text in the wrong place. —The word
desentiatis of Cicero's coinage, as the ut ita dicam indicates, in order to
express the idea of εὐπρέπεια better than could be done by venustas and
orde. [Schoemann reads el figurarum lum venustatem, the common read·
ing. stultes- thinks something has been lost, perhaps cum...corre·
sponding to luna] ’

126. 4. timidumque cognoscunt. One or the other cognoscunt
might have been omitted or something else, like dignoscunt, been used in
its place, but the haste of the writer is evident too in this repetition.

146 126. 7. intervalla, distinctio. The former denotes the differences

of tone inrespect to pitch‚ in English “intervals‚” διαστήματα affirmem
