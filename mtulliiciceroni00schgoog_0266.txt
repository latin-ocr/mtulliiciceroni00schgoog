96. 23. [neo cessantium &c., “neither leading a lise oi complete28
inactivity, as the Epicurean gods are represented to do, nor yet performing
their functions with a labor that' rs excessive or irltsomeff' Balbus alludes
to the remarks of Velleius m Ι, 20, 52]

96. 29. monogrammos deos. Gods,'who have only the outlines oi
a form, liniamentis dumtaxat extremis, as is said above Ι, 44, 123. In the
same way Lucilius called a pale and emaciated man, who was a mere
shadow, vix vivum hanzinem ac monogrammum. NoniuS, p. 37 Merc.
Comp. above Ι, 18, 49; 27, 75 ; 35, 98.

96. 34. [multae . ..naturae deorum. For the expression comp.
in the preceding chapter natura nsandi, ceterae naturae: De Fin. 4, 7,
16: amnis natnra vult esse conservatrix sui. Below 23, 62 he says simply
Utilitatum agitem magnitudine constituti sunt ei di]

96. 35. non sine causa. Tbese words express a concession or recog· 60
nition. The Stoic does not reject the view in question, though he does not
undertake to establish it by reasoning‚ because that is impossible for him
to do. The universality os the view alone gives it a claim to recognition.
Although he only allows it to hold good at first of individuals, and those Ι “
the wisest‚ yet its universal acceptance proves to him that there must have
been an anticipation of it in the minds of men.

97. 3. quod erat a deo natum. Comp. below ξ 62: qui utilitates
quasque gignebant,· and De offic. ΙΙ, 5,16: nulla tam detestabilis pestis
est, qaae merebamini ab homine nascatur.

97. 4. nornine ipsius del: so it is only by metonymy, the gifts being
called aiter the givers, not themselves deified as many erroneously thought.
Seel, 14, 38 and III 16, 41 Comp. Plutarch De Is et Osrr c. 70. ὥσπερ
ἡμεῖς τὸν ὠνοίμενου βιβλιαΠ λάτωνος ὠνεῖσθαί φαμεν Πλάτωνα, και Mt-
νανδρον ὑποκρίνεσθαι τον ro Μενάνδρου ποιήματα ὑποτιθέμενον, οὓτως ἐκεῖνοι
τοῖς τῶν θεῶν ὀνόμασι τὰ τῶν θεῶν δῶρα καὶ ποιήματα nalem οὑκ ἐφείδοντο.

Eun. IV, 5, 6.

· 97. 7. reslpsa. In default oi amore definite expression Cicero makestl
use os the vagae and general term res, a certain something wherein a
greater power is revealed, and in which a man, although he feels it within
himself, recognizes a gift or inspiration from higher powers. Comp. c. 31,
79. ln most Mss. vis is found after ut ea ipsa ,· evidently an error, as the
connection shows. Had Cicero thought it necessary to add a noun, he would
have used res .· as immediately aster, ipsa res deornm nomen obtinuit.

97. 9. a Μ. Aemilio Scauro; about noc. 645, when he was censor.
