89. 32. Sciteenim Chrysippus. The sense of the argument which 14

Cicero does not bring out very clearly is doubtless this: All which simply
serves something else as a means to an end is not absolutely, but only rela-
tively perfect. The universe alone, since it comprehends everything within
itseli and so serves nothing else as a means, is its own end and absolutely
perfect. Hence that cannot be wanting to it without which it would not
be absolutely perfect, namely‚ reason. - On enlm see note c. 16 init.

90. 3. ad mundum . ..imitandum This does not refer to an arti·
ficial or an artistic imitation os nature, but to a conformity in will and deed
with the supreme law os reason and right ; the ὁμολογουμένως τῇ piore ζῆν.
Comp. De Senect. c. 21, 77: Sed credo deos immortales sparsisse errimus
in corpora duntona, ut essent qui terras tuerentur, quique caelestium ordi·
neree contemplantes imitarentur eum vitae rende alque constantia; Senec.
De Vita Beata c. 3: a natura non deerrare el ad illiers legem exenzplumque
fhrmari, sapientia est. Other examples in Beier on Cic. De Olfic. 1,
P· 325.

90. 4. [Sed mundus ..complexus est. We should expect the 38
present here3 comp. De Fin. ll, 34, 112: non . . . marie pedibus pera·
grantem, sed omne eoelum . . . complexum ,· and ibid. 111, 5, 17: quiddam
. . . complexum et continens veritatem]

90. 9. similitudines adiungens. Chrysippus often used them3 see
above c. 8, 22.

90. 15. efficitur tamen in homine virtus. The general idea ol 39
virtus according to De Leg. Ι, 8, 22 is nihil aliusquem in se perfecta
et ad summum perducta reaturo, the complete development of all the
faculties and capacities of any being: τὸ τί ἦν εἶναι of Aristotle. Such
virtus is realized (efficiturz ad effectum perducitur) in man, i.e. in the
wise man (ξ 36), although rarely and with difficulty because os the hin·
drances which oppose him. It is however always realized in the divine
universe which nothing hinders (ξ 35).

90. 19. quae . . .gignuntur. Comp. c. 36, 92.-We have already15
seen Ι, 10, 25; 11, 27; 12, 30 that other philosophers before the Stoics
considered the heavenly bodies to be gods.

90. 22. animantia. Comp. Somn. Scip. c. 3: ex illis sempiternis
ignibus, quae sidera el stellas voeatis, quae. . . divinis animatae menti·
bus &c

90. 25. inmenso mundo. Cleomed. ll, 84: πάντα τὸν κόσμον φωτίζει 40
σχεδὸν ὰπειρομεγὲθη ὄντα, Inmenso mundo is a dativus commodi. [Schoe-
mann does not supply the ira]

90. 26. is elus tactus est, “its effect, its influence upon us is such”3
