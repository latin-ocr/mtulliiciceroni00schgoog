143. r. mun autmundo melius tn rerum natura. Balbus says 9
ΙΙ, 12, 32: mandras melior (est) quam sella aalma, and mundum univer·
sum pluris esse necesse es! quam partem aliquam universi: but he no·
whe're uses the peculiar expression chosen by Cotta, which really amounts
to only this, nr'leil est munda nelina irs munda This includes, itis true,
nulla pars mundi est munda melior ; bnt Cotta evidently uses it with the
object of offsettiug it with his own as a complete counterpart3 namely, Ne
in terris quidem urbe nostra, scil quicquam melius est: although the rela-
tions of the objects compared together in the two sentences, mundus to
rerum naturae, and urbs nostra to terrae, are essentInlly different—Thoe
following argumentation, which agrees completely with that of Alexinus
given by Sext. Emp. IX, 108, deserres the name of calumnia which
Balbus applies to similar ones 11, 7, 20. It grossly misuses the word
melius, which of course may mean very different things as applied to dif-

‚ ferent objects and relatious; and by taking it in some of its relative signi·
fications and applying it to the universe one may succeed in throwing an
appearance of ridicule on the opinion of the Stoics; but this vanishes as
soon as the word is taken in the sense which the Stoics intended. Comp.

143. 8. Istum locum Zenonls conclusio . . . dilatavit. [Schoe tt
mann reads dilatabit with the following note] “Zeno’s conclusion will
widen the application of that proposition '’ ; ae. by means of Zeno’s conclu·
sion the proposition can be made to include more than you would wish ; it
can be used to prove not only that the universe is intelligent but also that it
can read &c ΤΙιο expression may be compared with Ι, 35, 98: si semel
susceperimus genus hac argumenti, attende qua serpat. Dilatare is to
make a wider application of a thing; so in De Leg. ΙΙΙ, 14, 32: lex dila·
tata r‘n ordinem cunctum. ΤΙιε dilatavit of the Mss. is evidently false;
no one would imagine that Zeno so turned the proposition. Nor can dila·
tavit be equivalent to effecit ut dilatari possit. [We have kept the reading
dilatavit of Mliller, which is also given by Baiter in both editions. Ina
note Miiller proposes the present, ie. loeus conclusione dilatatur. There
seems to be no valid objection against the perfect, the sense being that
Zeno's way of putting the argument has made it possible to extend its ap·
plication farther than he intended]
