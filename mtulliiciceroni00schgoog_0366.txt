sermone 337

ΠΙ, 3, 8. elnon altero canineam for the Mss. contuear is an emenda·
tion accepted also by Baiter after Madvig’s confident recommendatione So
in c. 4, 9 cur coniveres for contueres found in the best Mss, which others
have changed into contuerere. The variations in Plinius, eg. X, 75, 97,
p. 215 Sillig‚ besides the examples cited by M, show how commonly the
copyists confused these two verbs.

111, 9, 23. Saepe dixti nihilsteri sine deo nee ullam vim esse staturae,
retsui dissimilia posset effingere. 'The statement nihil fieri sine deo no·
where occurs, at least in this form, in the discourse of Balbus; and even
supposing that here, where the Stoic doctrine of the disinity of the world
iscriticized‚ sine deo were equivalent to sene mundo, there can bave been
no probable reason why Cotta should not choose the expression which was
evidently more fitting and liable to no mistake. One Ms, certainly not of
the best, which Creuzer denotes by La, has sine mundas but, as neundus has
been mentioned just before, sine eo might appear sufficient and more prob
able, as it did to Creuzer. But even thus the expression does not seem
definite and clear enough to designate what is here required. fieri sine
aliquo may be said of everything which takes place without the coopera-
tion of any one ; but here, where the question is plainly of the origin of
things, where the mundus is to be conceived as not only codperatiug but
as creating and producing, some other expression seems to be required.
Heindorf saw this plainly and for sine eo conjectured nisi ex eo, just as we
find shortly after ex eo procreantur: comp. ΙΙ, 35, 88: mundus ex que ori·
untur et fiunt omnia. —In the next sentence nee ullam vim esse naturae,
ut sui dissimilia posset effingere we must evidently understand by natura
only nature in general (natura mundi ΙΙ, 22, 58, ἡ τοῦ blau φύσις Μ. Aurel.
VII, 75), ie. the creative power of tbe universe, but not any natural ex·
istence in particular. Hence Walker rightly saw that we should read illam
for ullam. It is further to be noticed that the expression sui dissimilia,
which Cotta employs, does not quite correspond to the sense of what Bal·
bus had said; for Balbus had not and could not say that the all-creating
matura could create nothing *unlike itself, but only that it could create
nothing better and more perfect than itself 3 ΙΙ, 33, 86: ea quae efferant

’ aliquid ex sese perfectiores habere naturas quam ea quae ex iis efferendum·
comp. 11, 8, 21.

111, 14, 36. intrinsecus is the reading, undoubtedly correct, of Bouhier
instead of the opposite extrinsecus, which is here impossible ; formerly 1
adopted et sentiens, proposed by Wyttenbach in its place. Although there
may be no other example of intrinsecus animal, the explanation gum ‘ux
ihc notes is not to be doubted.
