quae suntin uobis the defects (vitia) indicated by the preceding words are
intended. Comp. ΙΙ, 8, 21.

56. 3. florere . . . Academiam. [That is the gods would find in
each other tantam similitudinem, ut in iis nullo inesset certa iudicandi
nota, as Cicero puts it in ξ 5 oi this book; they would periorce be New
Academicians] The joke ol course must not be taken too seriously; lor
although the gods might not be able to distinguish between themselves,
they might distinguish other objects.

56. 17. crocodilum dre. The same beasts were not accounted holy
in all parts oi Egypt ; those which were worshipped in one part might be
killed with impunity in another, as Herodotus Il, 69 expressly says in regard

instead oi quam tibi illa vestra Sospita videtur, isa common attraction ln
such comparisons. Similar instances in c. 31, 86 and II, 11, 29. Further
examples ln Wunder’s note to Cic. pro Plane, p. 103 ; and Madvig’s note to
