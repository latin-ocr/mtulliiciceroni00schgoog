58. 21. argumenta sententiae conclusisti [Miiller reads argu-
mento senteutiam], “you have drawn up the arguments for your opinion in
regular, syllogistic forms.'’ Comp. De Fin. ΙΙΙ, 8, 27 : concluduntur egitur
eorum argumenta sic,· Acad. II, 9, 27: quae esset conclusi argumenti
fides. For the conclusion of Velleius see above c. 18, 48.—The reading
of this passage is uncertain. The Mss. have argumenti sententiam, which
ispossibly an error for argumenti summam. summam orationis is used
in the same signification in De Or. ΙΙ, 38, 158 and summa is confounded
with sententiae by the copyists in other passages. See Madvig De F iu. 11,

31, roo.

82 58, 28. sumpsisses, “you might have assumed it,” :sumere poteras

89 or debebas, as below ΙΙΙ, 31, 76 dedisses. See Zumpt Gr. ξ 529 Rem.;
Madvig De F in. II, 12, 353 Naeke’s note on Valer. Cato, p. 161 ; Wagner
Virg. AEn. IV, 678.-Quld autem est &c [Schoemann reads qui on the
ground that the question really is, not what the gradatim means, but with
what propriety it can be applied to the formos argument of Velleius]
On the frequent confusion see Schoemann Opusc. Ac. ΙΙΙ, pp. 305, 325.

so 58. 35. formae figuram, “the structure of the form ” (die Bildung
der Gestalt), as Lucretius says, IV, 67: veterem serenae servare figuram.
Forma denotes the form as shown in the general impression which it
makes, figura the structure and relation of the parts ; the fhrma stands out
visibly3 the inncr construction enters into the figura. Hence Cicero says
in De Offic. l, 35, 126: ferrerium nostram ceteramque figuram ,· and the
colour may also enter into the fornia, ibid. 36,130: saraiae dignitas coloris
bonitate tuenda—On the following dl semper fuerunt see the Sum·
mary, p. 27.

59. 3. ea, quaerant forma di. The ferreria of the preceding clause
is repeated, as often happens, in the relative clause for the sake of greater
precision; and the use of the demonstrative ea in the foregoing need not
prevent such repetition, as has been supposed. Comp. Caes¹ Bell. Galil,
49, 1: ultra eum locum, quo in loco Germani consederant,· Cic. in Catil.
ΙΙΙ, 10, 2 5: intimantem reno bello, quale bellum,· Pro Cluent. c. 54 init:
lex ea, qua lege: and ibid. 57,166; De Repub. 1, 26: adeam cansam
reflerendmn est, qreae causa gennit civitatem.

91 59. 9. putamus? ‘⁶ Shall we then believe?” For the indicative in
such questions see note to ξ 84.

83 59.15. memoriter, not as often explained “from memory‚” bnt “with
good memory‚ correct memory” [“mindfully'' from memor.], forgetting
nothing, see Madvig De Fin., p. 74.
