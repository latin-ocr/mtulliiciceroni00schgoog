BOOK 1.—cnn. XXVII, ξς 71-77. 211

53. 31. istud quasi corpus . ..quid intellegis? The argument
is here resumed aiter the digression, “now what do you understand by this
quasi corpus?” Comp. De Fin. II, 15, 50 : Quid ergo icoc loco intellegit
honestum? Paradox VI, 1 : quem enim intellegimus divitem, author ver·
bum in quo homine ponimus?

53. 32. [Ego 01111111050110810. The sense is: Iam quite willingto 74
acknowledge that you know more about these things thani do 3 but once
state them in the form 01 propositions, and there is no reason whyI should
not comprehend them as well as you]

54. 3. tamquam Heraclitus. Cicero also hints iarther on in ΙΙΙ, 14,
25 that the obscurity 01 Heraclitus, 101 which he was called ὁ σκοτεινάς, was
intentiona13 [De Fin. ΙΙ, 5, 15]. This strange idea is found also in other
authors, as in Diog. L. IX, 6.- Quod inter nos liceat. The fuller expres·
sion Ad Attic. 11, 4, r: qued inter 1101 liceat dicere: [comp. ξ 59, bona
venia 1111 1111111111]Ι ’

5410. similitudines rerum esse 101 sunt,· transition from orat.
rect. to orat. obliq. In the next section 101 nec 1111 hamana dec. he might
have said nec sit, continuing the dependence on qued.

54. 10. [Fae id . . ,1111111 esse persuasum3 “Suppose me to be
persuaded oi that which cannot even be comprehended.” id is* to be taken
with persuasum]

54. 19. Primum quidque, “each one in its order ''; that is, always 11
taking the object which ior the moment stands at the head oi the others.
The proper explanation 01 this often misunderstood expression is given by
Giese‚ note to Cic. De Div. l, 57, 127 ; and Madvig De Fin. note, p. 321.

54. 26. deos ipsos. Comp. Plut. De Is. et Osir. c. 71: 01111 χαλκᾶ

ἀλλὰ θεοὺς καλεῖν. In Cic. De Div. in Caec. c. 1, 3 the Sicilians complain:

eorum simulacra sanctissima C. Verres e delubris religiosissimis abstu· ,
iisset.
