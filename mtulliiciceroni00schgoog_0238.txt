65. 33. Metrodori. He appears also in Plutarch in the passage cited
above as a very strong defendet of sensuous pleasure: αῐανται δὲ περὶ yo-
στέρα τάγαθὸν εἶναι καὶ τοὺς ἀλλους πόρους τῆς σαρκὸς ἅπαντας, δι’ ὼν
ἡδονὴ ἐπεισέρχεται, καὶ πάντακαλὰ καὶ σοφὰ ἐξευρήματα τῆς περὶ γαστέρα
ἡδονῆς ἕνεκα γεγονέναι καὶ τῆς ὑπὲρ ταύτης ἐλπίδας ἀγαθῆς, ὣς ὀ σοφὸς

66. 12. ne intereat. These words are wanting in the Mss.‚ but are
preserved in the citation of the passage in Augustin. Epist. 56 tom. 11,
p. 267, ed. Basil. 1569. It is not advisable to strike them out and to read
non pereat or uon conteratur for uon vereatur. The idea is that the
continual fear of annihilation must interfere with the happiness of the
gods.

66. 14. affluant, sc. ad nos, which, being so easily understood, could
very well be omitted. Comp. c. 19, 49.

66. 16. de sanctitate. Comp. c. 44, 122. Among the works of Epi· 115
curus cited by Diog. L. X, 27 is one περὶ ὁσιότητος, Whether there was a
special one περὶ εὐσεβείας is not known.

cero also speaks of him (II, 66, 165) as a man beloved of the gods for his
goodness; in ΙΙΙ, 2, 5 asan authority in matters of religion, he says the
same also of P. Scaevola.

66. 18. Scaevolam, ie. P. Mucium P. F. Q. N. who was Pontifex
Maximus in 631.

66. 20. ut Xerses. Herod. VIII, 109 and many others state that

Greece.

66. 22. homiues non colant. Comp. Plaut. Poen. V, 4, 14: Juppe'·
ter, qui genus colis alisque homiuum-The word is evidently here chosen
chiefly on account of the colendos preceding; comp. Ovid. Metam. VIII,

724: Cura pii dis sunt, etqui coluere coluntur.
66. 23. At cst eorum &c With reference to what Velleius said in ης

c· ¹7145·

66. 29. pietas, iustitia adversum deos. Inasmuch as justice yields
to every one that which is due, it includes what is due to the gods.
Cic. Partit. Or. c. 22, 78: In communione autem quae posita pars est
(virtutis) iustitia dicitur, eaque erga deos religit, erga parentes pietas,
vulgo autem bonitus,· Macrob. In Somn. Scip. 1, 8, 7 : De iustitia veniunt
innocentia, amicitia, concordia, pietas, religio,· Lact. Div. Inst. VI, 10:

Primum iustitiae officium est coniungi cum deo, secundum cum domiue.
