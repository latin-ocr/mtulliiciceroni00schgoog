it. On the other hand what Cicero expresses by opposita is called in astro-
nomical language conjunction, σύνοδος, when moon and sun stand near
each other iu the heavens, the moon being between the earth and the sun,
and in regard to us before the sun, opposita, or sometimes just under it,
suppositam which case a total or partial eclipse results. Thales under·
stood the causes of the eclipses of the sun and moon so well that he was
able to predict one of the sun. See Diog. L. 1, 23 with the remark of
Menoge. But this isdoubted by more recent writers on the history of
astronomy. See Philol. XXII, p. 550.

111. 3. [notarum. So Ms. Α, and Baiter in both edd. Schoemann 104
has the following note]: notato . . . similitudine. The Mss. have in part
nota, in part notarum, the latter being only a conjecture, which is gram·
matically admissiblc and not improbable on diplomatic grounds; but the
reading in the text notato is quite as probable, i.e. animadverso et con·
signata, understanding as subject the imagination of the observet.

111. 5. Aratus of Soli incilicia, nc. 275› wrote a didactic poem in 41
two parts, Φαινόμενα, “phenomena of the stars,” and Διοσημεῖα (Διοσημίαι),
“signs of the weather ''; it was translated by Cicero, and again by Caesar
Germanicus, ie. Domitian, not as has been supposed by the son of Drusus,
¹adopted son of Tiberius. Of Cicero’s translation we have only fragments,
though of considerable extent; of that of Germanicus the first part is com·
plete‚ of the second only a couple of verses remain. Besides these there is
a translation of Rufus Festus Avienus of the fourth century much more
free than those of Cicero or Domitiam but these last even, lilre all the an·
cient translators‚ did not consider such exactness necessary as is nowadays
required in a translator.

ιιι. 9. cetera. The other heavenly bodies in contradistinction to
the immorable axis.

111.14. uupnei' de cardine, “on the two-sold axis.'' Cicero calls 105
the axis around which the universe revolves two-fold (this he did not find
in Aratus), because he imagines it as divided into two parts by the earth,
which lies in the middle of the universe, and through which the axis neces·
sarily passes. -Τιιε pole which he has in mind is the North pole, the only
one visible to us.

111. 17. Cynosura, the little bear, properly only the polar star, then
the whole constellation 3 Helice, the great bear, also called the septem
triones, the seven plough oxen‚ or in the singular septentrio on account of
the seven very bright stars which compose it; this name was then also
given to the lesser bear, the Cynosura. See c. 43, ιιι andhleyue suxisse,

Georgics ΙΙΙ, 381.
