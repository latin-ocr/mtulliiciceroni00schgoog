aa 53-10· (1111111111, passages, chiefly from poets, which were dictated to
scholars to be learned by heart. Comp. Hor. Ep. 1, 18, 13 : puerum saevo
credas dictata azagr'slro reddere.

53. 12. inscriptis. Diog. L. X, 13 mentions a saying 01 Epicurus 01
this sort in a letter. He also cites from another letter (ξ 6) the words:
παιδείαν δὲ πᾶσαν, μακάριε, φεῦγε, “

5 3. 14. 1111111 enirn olet: nullum odorem olet ,· 11. he shows no famili·
arity with the schools 01 Plato or Aristotle, the tormer 01 ¹whom taught in
the Academy, the latter in the Lyceum, both names 01 gymnasia at Athens.
Ad Attic. II, 1, 1 : ideo bene olere, quia nihil olebant, videbantur.

53. 15. epuerllibus dlsclplluls. He means the so·called ὲγκὺκλιος
παιδεία, that is, the usual course 01 instruction, consisting chiefly 01 gram·
mar and rhetoric.

53. 16. Xenocraten. See note to 13, 34

53. 18. Pamphilum. He is also mentioned in Diog. L. X, 14, but is
otherwise unknown. Whether he is the same with the author 01 a τέχνη
1111ορ, mentioned by Arist. Rhet. II, 23, we cannot tell. Comp. Spalding’s
note to Quintil. III, 6, 34.

53. 20. agripeta, 11. as colonist, Gr. κληροῦχος, because in the year
lac. 351 the Athenians gave to the poorer citizens the confiscated land in
Samos, divided into 2000 sections (κλῆροι).

73 53. 23. ln Nausiphane...tenetur. 'ibe sense is: In regard to
Nausiphanes he cannot avoid it; he is proved to have learned something
from him, which he would not allow in regard to Pamphilus, though he
confessed to having heard him. Comp. Orat. pro Caec. e. 2 : facile hones-
tissimis testr'bus in re perspicua teneretur, i.e. convinceretur: and further

Pyrrhon, but is spoken 01 by Diog. Praei. 15 as a sollower 01 Democritus.
Cotta also says below c. 33, 93 that Epicurus learned something from him.
It was maintained that he was indebted to him 101 his logie (see note to c.
16, 43). For remarks 01 Epicurus about him see Diog. L. X, 14, and 7, 8.

53. 26. quid audierat? The sense is: Epicurus spoke insultingly
01 Nausiphanes as 11 he owed nothing to him. And yet 11 he had not
learned something from him what could he have learned at all? He
would have been utterly ignorant, and would not have known even these
doctrines 01 Democritus, on which his whole system 01 physics rests.

53. 30. naturae ratio· Comp. c. 8, 20 ι physiologiam, id est naturae
rationem, and note.
