The date of writing this book may be determined if not with
entire certainty, yet with the greatest probability. That it was writ-
ten before the murder of Caesar, that is before the Ides of March,
710, follows without any doubt from the manner in which Caesar's
supremacy is spoken ofin Ι, 4, 7; and that Cicero was occupied
upon it in the summer of 709 may be inferred from the letter¹ to
Atticus written in June of this year (XIll, 39, 2), where he asks him
for the book of Phaedrus περὶ θεῶν doubtless to make use of it in
the composition of this book. - But the greater part of Cicero's phi-
Iosophical workS, the Academica, De Finibus, Tusculan Disputationes,
De Divinatione, De Fata, De Senectute, De Officiis, De Amicitia, and

was the death in March, 709, of his daughter Tullia, his favorite
child, to whom he was most tenderly devoted, and whose loss
afflieted him most deeply. He expresses his state of mind in a
letter to Atticus (Xll, 14, 3), written in March, 709: an'l de
