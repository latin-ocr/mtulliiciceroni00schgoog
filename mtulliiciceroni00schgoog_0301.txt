Aelian. V. H. V, 14 and others state that in ancient times it was considered
wrong to kill an ox in Italy and Greece, aud it was forbidden under severe
punishment. Pliny H. N. VIII, 45, p. 556 narrates that at Rome a man
was once punished with exile ior this crime. The ox was only rarely offered
in sacrifice to the gods, under particular circumstances. See Hermann
Gottesd. Alterth.§ 26, 20 or Schoemann Griech. Alterth. 11³, p. 245.

τὸ δὲ πρὸς τὸν πόλεμον μάλιστα nutricia: and the subject is treated in
detail.

130. 25. remediat ...ellgamus [Schoem. reads eliciamus, and
says:] We gain from them medicinal remedies by investigation and
labor, as above c. 60, 151: e terrae cavernis ferrum elicimus [for eligi-
