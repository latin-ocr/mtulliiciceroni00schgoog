BOOK IL—Cnnr. VIH, §5 18-21. 239

84. 26. aestus maritimi, the ebb and flow of the ocean. See 111,
10, 24. Sinrilar movements ol the sea occur in some narrow passages in
the Mediterranean, asin the Euripus and the Fretum Siculum3 also in the
Adriatic sea according to Strabo V, 1, 5, p. 212. Hence the expression
fretorum angustiae. The old naturalists generally held that these move-
ments were caused by the inssuenee of the moon: τῶν περὶ τὸν ὠκεανὸν
nbnycpvpibav καὶ ἀμπώτεων αῦτη (ri σελήνη) αἰτία ἐστι’, says Cleomedes in the
treatise on the phenomena of the heavens, II, 1, p. 105 ; and Bake, p. 416
cites several others. [Comp. De Div. ΙΙ, 14, 34: Quid dc fretis auide
marinis aestibus plura dicam? quarum accessus ct recessus luccae matu
gubernantur]

84. 27. una totius caeli conversione cursus astrorum dispares.
The stars have an apparent motion with the whole heavcns around the
earth, but not all at the same rate. The greater part of them move so that
they always keep the same place in the heavens, thus moving only along
with the heavens, and these are called stellae fixac,· others move in such
manner that while moving along with the heavens around the earth they
have an independent motion of their own, and are seen nowhere and now
there 3 they are therefore called planctae. But these cursus dispares also
sollow an established law; hence the expression conservari. Comp.
c. 20, 51·

84. 30. et continuato. The adjective is thus placed in order to
bring out more pointedly the¹ idea that the soul of the universe is to be con·
ceived as a continuans, undivided whole.

8431. fusius is sometimes wrongly translated “at greater length”; ρο
it means “in loose discourse, not confined to a strict order and division.”
Cic. De Leg. I, 13, 36: quacsusc alim disputabantur ac· libere, ca nunc ar·
ticulatim dissecta dicuntur. See Bake’s remark. [But uberius and su·
sius seem to be opposed here to brevius and augustius in the next sentence.
So Orat. ΙΙ, 38, 159: ct genus sermonis affert Stoicus nan liquidum, nan
susum ac profluens, scd exile, aridum, concisum ac minutum ,· Quint. II,
4, 7 ι necteria abundantior atquc ultra quam apartcatfusa. See the ex-
amples in Harpers’ Latin Dictionary s. v.-Academtcorum calum-
niam. So Acad. II, 5, 14: Arcesilae calumnia]

84. 34. utprofluens amnis. Asimilar comparison occurs in Quint.
XII,2,11.

85. 3. Zeno· His own words arc cited in Sext. Emp. IX, 104. Diog.2⁸l
L. VII, 143, ascribes the same argumentation to Chrysippus, Apollodorus
and Posidonius.
