chiefly leguminous plants3 not however exclusively‚ but according to
Varro R. R. Ι, 23, 2 those quae velluntur a terra, nan subsecantur ,· quae,
quod ito leguntur, legumina Δίαιος and 32, 2: dicta a legendo, quod ea
non secantur sed vellendo leguntur. Gr. χέδροποι, χέδροπα or χέδροπες,
which is considered as a corruption of χέρδροποι, from χείρ and ὁρέπω,

129. 23. nlsl forto . . dubitationem adfert, quin . . . To under· ἓξ
stand the clause with quin properly we must bear in mind that the sense
of the preceding one is: nam non sane dubitationem offert.

129. ²7· bestias hominum gratia. What the Academic might have
replied to this may be gathered‚ since the corresponding passage in the
third book is lost, from Porphyrius De Abst. ΙΙΙ, 20. See also what Celsus
says and what Origen ctr. Cels. IV, 74 answers.

129. 30. noque all . . . potuissent. This pluperfect is often used in
this way instead of the imperfect, inasmuch as the possibility of the thing
is represented as the condition which must be fulfilled before the thing
itself can take place. Comp. De Offic. ΙΙ, 3, 12: nequeenim valetudinis
curatio neque agri cultura . . ,sine homiuum opera ulla esse potuisset: ·
Ibid. c. 4,152 quid esaumerem artium multitudinem, sine quibus vita
omniuo nulla esse potuisset. In the same way audire potuisses, above Ι,
21, 57, is to be explained3 andri potuero, often used for si potero is to be
regarded from the same point of view

sheep not only would not now be able to exist and flourish, but would never

have been able to do so at any time, according to the original ordinance of

nature.
1²9·]35. sc osse generatos. Eos would have been more correct: but

the reflexive is used because canes, though not grammatically the subject,
is thought of as such, being implied in canum custodio.

130. 4. abillo aureo genero Aratus, whom Cicero has in mind lta
here, and from whom he quotes the following verses 130 ff.‚ says of the
golden age, v. 110: οὗτος δ’ ἔζωον, χαλεπὴ δ’ ἀπέκειτο θάλασσα, καὶ βίον
οὔπω νῆες ἀπόπροθεν ὴγίνεσκον, ἀλλὰ βόες roi ἄροτρα &c.; but according to
others (as Hesiod W.& D. v. 117; Virgil‚ Georg. 1,125; Ovid, Met. 1,
101) the earth produced in abundance in that age all sorts of fruits spon·
