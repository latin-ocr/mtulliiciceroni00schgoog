pared myseli well, as l had to do to meet such an antagonist as the Stoic3
whereas to meet an Epicurean required no particular preparation. Cotta
had said before (ξ 1) that he was preparing himself during the discourse
of Balbus to reply to it: quid contra dicerem, meditabar,· and when he
remarks there, as well as below in §4 that he hopes not so much lo refute
Balbus as to beg for further explanation on several points, we recognize
not only the Academic philosopher despairing ol further knowledge, but
the man of the world paying a compliment; not without a touch oi irony
too which does not escape Balbus, who answers: siu me interrogaremus
non tam intellegendi causa quam refellendi &o Sic, instead of si, an
error of the copyists, is similarly used by Cicero in De Fin. ΙΙΙ, 2, 9: iam
infici debet iis artibus, quas si, dum est tener, combiberit, ad maiora ueniet
paratior.-Sic,· et quidem diligentius saepiusque ista loquemur iuter

138. 16. Ο. Laelium, the famous bosom friend of Scipio Africanus the
younger, whom Cicero introduces as the speaker in his discourse on friend-
ship. He was called by his contemporaries the wise man, sapiens, and
