gods external good things only, is not made by the Stoic, but by
the Academic as against the Stoic (ΙΙΙ, 36, 87). He is wrong in
representing this view as generally prevailing (as is shown in the
note to that passage) 3 but those who consider it as the only opinion
held by the Stoics are no more in the right3 sor in the Stoic system
there was nothing which clashed at all with the directly opposite
vrew.

While the Stoic theology attempted in the manner just described
partly to correct and complete, partly to explain and so support the
popular religion, it encountered, in common with the irreligion os
Epicurus, which in reality was little better than atheism, the opposi-
tion of the critical scepticism of the New Academy, which held any
certain knowledge on any subject to ,be impossible, conceding only
a greater or less degree os probability3 and hence carried on a con-
tinual strife with the dogmatism oi the other schools. Arcesilas. the
founder oi this later Academy, not only repeated the famous propo·
sition oi Socrates, that he knew only one thing, and that was, that
he knew nothing; but he went beyond him. saying that even this,
that he knew nothing, he did not know, but only surmised it.¹ He
and his followers considered nothing as absolutely certain but reason
and the right of using it; even this however they held could not
help us to a sure knowledge of things. All thought, so they argued,
can only proceed upon certain data3 the only data we have are those
of experience, which come from impressions on the senses3 but
these impressions are unreliable, they are undoubtedly often false,
and there is no persectly sure criterion whereby to distinguish the true
from the false. Hence complete certainty oi knowledge is impos-
sible, we can only attain to mere opinions. These may be true,
they may be false as well; and after all testing and comparing we
cando no more than distinguish various grades oi probability,
and, since actual knowledge is beyond our reach, we must content
ourselves with reasonable opinion and belief. Hence, whenever a
definite opinion was advanced on any subject, they were accus·
temed to take the opposite side, in order to show that there was
nothing which did not admit of discussion, and that it became the

wise man to withhold any definite and confident judgment; assen-
