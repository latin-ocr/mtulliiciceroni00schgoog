chiefly leguminous plants3 not however exclusively‚ but according to
Varro R. R. Ι, 23, 2 those quoe velluntur e terra, uon subsecantur ,· quae,
quod ita leguntur, legumina dicta: and 32, 2: dicto a legendo, quod ea
non secantur sed vellendo leguntur. Gr. χέδροποι, χέδροπα or χέδροπες,
which is considered as a corruption of χέρδροποι, from χείρ and dotrro.
Comp. Nicand. Theriac. 6523 Ideler, Arist. Meteor. ΙΙ, ρ. 526.

1²9· 23. nisi forto . . . dubitationem adfert, quin . . . To under· {3533
stand the clause with quin properly we must bear in mind that the sense
of the preceding one is: nom non sone dubitationem offert,

129. 27· bestias hominum grotta. What the Academic might have
replied to this may be gathered, since the corresponding passage in the
third book is lost, from Porphyrius De Abst. ΙΙΙ, 20. See also what Celsus
says and what Origen ctr. Cels. IV, 74 answers.

129. 30. nequo ali . . . potuissent. This pluperfect is often used in
this way instead of the imperfect, inasmuch as the possibility of the thing
is represented as the condition which must be fulfilled before the thing
itself can take place. Comp. De Offic. ΙΙ, 3, 12: nequeenim valetudinis
curatio neque ogei cultura . . .sine bominum opera ullo esse potuisset,· ·
Ibid. c. 4,15: quid enumerem artium multitudinem, sine quibus uita
omnino nulla esse potuisset. In the same way audire potuisses, above I,
21, 57, is to be explained; and si potuero, often used fossi potero is to be
regarded from the same point of view

[The possibility of happening would seem to be a necessary condition
to the actual happening of any thing whatever ; otherwise it would never
happen. The idea of possibility lies here not in the tense, but in the very
signification of the word potuissent ,· and the difference between potuissent
and possent is that the former represents the possibility as existing at some
earlier time. The idea seems to be that if it were not for the care of men
sheep not only would not now be able to exist and flourish, but would never
have been able to do so at any time, according to the original ordinance of
nature]

129. 35. so osse generatos. Eos would have been more correct: but
the reflexivc is used because canes, though not grammatically the subject,
is thought of as such, being implied in conum custodio.

130. 4. abillo aureo genere. Aratus, whom Cicero has in mind 1⁶9
here, and from whom he quotes the following verses 130 ff, says of the
golden age, v. 110: οὕτως δ’ ἔζωον, χαλεπὴ δ’ ἀπέκειτο θάλασσα, καὶ βίον
οῦπω νῆες ἀπόπροθεν ὴγίνεσπου1 ἀλλὰ βόες καὶ ἄροτρα &c.; but according to
others (as Hesiod W& D. v. 1173 virgil, Georg. 1‚125; Ovid, Met. Ι,
101) the earth produced in abundance in that age all sorts of fruito spons
