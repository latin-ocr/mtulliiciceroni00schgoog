justification of the belief in the gods, thus concisely stated: as
it is certain that the universe and its everlasting order have not
been produced by human power and human wisdom, so is it equally
certain that the being which did produce them is higher than man.
But beings higher than man must be gods3 we can conceive noth-
ing else higher than man, because man alone is endowed with rea-
son, and reason is the highest possible endowment. If then there
exists anything higher than men (and to deny itwould be the most
foolish presumption), it follows that there must be gods (16). This
argument, which, as may be seen, takes for granted the idea of the
gods as superhuman intelligent beings and is only directed to show
that such beings must of necessity exist, is then somewhat further
developed. It would be foolish to think that the universe was in·
tended to be an abode for men alone and not for higher beings as
well.—Human reason itself, limited and incomplete as it is, pre·
supposes the existence of a more complete and hence a divine
reason from which it is derived. Just as everything which pertains
to the bodily organization of man is derived from elements existing
in the world, so must the best in man, the thinking spirit, be de-
rived from a thinking being existing in the world3 and it would be
absurd were we to ascribe to the universe everything except the
highest and best (17, 1'8). Finally, the wise order of the world,
the connection and interpenetration of all its parts lead necessarily
to the recognition of a divine spirit governing and holding together
the whole (19). Some short propositions of Zeno follow summing
up in syllogistic forms the essentials of the foregoing argument
(zo-22). Next comes a detailed deductiori from the speculative
physies of the Stoics, the preceding proofs having all been drawn
from the point of view of the ordinary human reason. All vegetable
and animal life in the universe depends upoQ for individual
motion and activity can only dwell in what is endowed with heat;
life is only a definite, uniform mode of activity, which proceeds from
the principle of heat existing in all living bodies, and this principle
is thus seen to pervade the whole universe (23, 24). This general
prevalence is further evident from the fact that we find heat in all

oned dreams and revelations; secondum) τῶν μετεώρων, from the contempla·
