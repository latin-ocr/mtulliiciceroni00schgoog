are stupid affairs and we discard them altogether, we are not on this
account to reject the popular deities too; only we must have the right idea

101. 6. superstitiosi. It is quite clear that the derivation of the ii

¹ word given in the text deserves no consideration; nor any more the vari·
ous opinions oi ancients and moderns, excepting perhaps that os J. Grimm,
Deutsche Mythol. II, p. 1059: ‘⁴ superstitio, from superstes, denotes in the
case oi individual men a continued persistence in opinions which the
majority of sensiblc persons have abandoned.”

101. 9. religiosi arelegendo. See note 1, a, 3. The verse cited by
Gellius IV, 9: relegentem te oportet esse, religiosus ue fuas (for that is the
true reading), cannot be held to warrant the derivation given in the text by
Cicero, as religans is not a current word, but one manufactured by the poet
to support that derivation. Competent scholars have long thought that no
grammatical objection lies against the derivation from religare, especially
when it is considered that there was an old form legire for ligare. Comp.
Ebel in the Zeitsch. t'. vgl. Sprachk. IV, p. 449.

101.12. [superstitioso aud religioso here designate merely the
words superstitiosus and religiosus ,· but in accordnnce with the more usual
Latin usage are taken into the sentence and put in the ablative as though
they were used in their actual meaning. See Niigelsbach Lat. Styl.

101. 25· Areopagi. ln Cicero’s time the Areopagus had, as the coun- ti
cil of state, a far more extended sphere and more important influence on
public affairs than in the flourishing period ol Athens, when, especially after
Pericles, its competence was very limited. Comp. Ahrens de Athen. statu
