Christian apologists are very fond of making use of it in argument. Many
passages might be cited from Clem. Alex. (Protrept.), from Arnobius, Lac·
tentius and others, from L. Ampelius (Liber Memoriales), and Johannes
Lydus (De Mens), some of which support, others contradict the indicatious
given by Cicero. The only point to be noticed here is that under all the
names hereafter mentioned, even Aether, Caelus, Sol and the like, accord·
ing to the doctrine of Euhemerus, we are to understand human beings of
former ages who actually bore those names.

152. 33. cuius . . . sepulcrum ostenditur. Callimachus expresses
indignation at this, Hymn. in Iov. v. 8: Κρῆτες ἀεὶ ψευσταὶ· καὶ γὰρ τά-
φον, nidva, σεῖο Κρῆτες ἑτεκτὴναντο· σὺ δ’ ori θάνες· ἐσσὶ γὰρ aiei,

152. 35. qui appellantur Anaces Athonis. The name has the
same meaning apparently as Ἄνακτες. Tbeir temple at Athens, τὸ Ἀνα-
κεὶον, is often mentioned; but they are not generally distinguished from
the Tyndaridae. Cf. Plut. Thes. c. 33; Nurac. 13.

153.1. [Tritopatreus a son of Jupiter by Proserpine. Schoemann
reads Tritopatores, [Zagreus]‚ Eubuleus, Dionysus, with the following
note:] Tritopatores, properly “ancestors'’ (Pollux III, 7). The name
seems io have been applied in long-forgotten theogonies to certain deities
to whom the origin of the human race was attributed. Cf. Lobeck Agl,
pp. 754-765, according to whose opinion Zagreus, wanting in the Mss, is
here inserted in the text. It is impossible to explain with certainty or to
forman opinion upon the statements here made by Cotta on the authority
of his theologi, as we have no knowledge of the data which formed the
basis of their opinions. [See also Preller, Griech. Myth. I, 371.]

54 153.12. quae Heliopolis appellatur. The Aegyptian name was
On, at the same time the name of the god. According to Jablonski,
Panth. Aeg. 1, p. 137, it means “light''

153.13. quern Acantho Rhodi. The name does not occur else·
where ; it is singular too that the father's name is not mentioned with the
mother’s; the passage is doubtless corrupt, and it is impossible to restore it.

22 153.16. Apollinem eum. There is no verb here to govern the ac-

50 cusative 3 for the following esse voluerunt belongs only to the relative
clause, which svas itself the cause of the omission. It wonld have been
very easy to supply it, as it must have been some word of the sanie mean·
ing as esse voluerunt. Α case of anacoluthia not unlike this is found in
Brut. c. 27, 105: Hunc qrei erudierant prudentes homines, in quibus so-
militaris noster L. Gellius, qui se illi corztreberualem r'n corzsulolu fuisse
narrabor, carrorum oratorem el volubilem fuisse dicebat. Here the predi·

cate is wanting for leoninas. lt would be dz'celann but the following
