vituperatum. Epicurus in ridicule called him Ληρόκριτος. Diog, L,
X, {a 8. Nausiphanon. See c. 26, 73 srom which passage the insertion
of non before nihil, wanting in most Mss., is justified. ·

84 60. 10. Apollodorum, suum, two philosophers not otherwise known 3
for the Epicurean Apollodorus, who according to Diog. L. X, 2 and 25 was
Zeno's teachcr, is out os the question. It might sooner be the Stoic men·
tioned in Diog. L. VII, 39, where the other name Syllus has been
restored upon conjecture. Other suppositions are not worth mentioning.

60.12. Latino verbo utens. This is not incredible, inasmuch aswe
may assume some knowledge of Latin in the caseos philosophers whose
lectures were attended in great measure by Romans. Zeno might have
used the Latin word for the reason that it indicated better than any Greek
word what he wished to express, that sort of idle lounging about and that
untiring loquacity which characterized the scurra, and which might have
been criticised even in Socrates by his enemies. The comic poet Eupolis
also called him πτωχὸς ἀδολέσχης. Meineke Fragm. com. V, 1, p.
LXXXVIII.

60. 13. Chrysippam. He probably meant to ridicule awordyloquac·
ity like that of a talkative old woman; Chrysippus was in fact a very
voluminous and wordy writer, and ypaolayia was the expression for loquac-
ity. Sext. Emp. ndv. Gram. ξ 141.

91 60. 14. senatum...re01tares, like a censor; comp. Liv. XXIII,
23, 5; and XXIX, 37, 1 ; Cic. Orat. pro Domo, c. 32, 84.

6618. lucubratione anloularum. Not only study but the labour
of women by lamplight were designated by lucubratz'anes,· iri Liv.1, 57
S. Tarquinius finds Lucretia sitting iuter lucubrantes ancillan- Cotta says
therefore that Epicurus’s notions about the gods are hardly fit for old
womcn’s spinning-rooms.

115 6ο. 23. nam quod . . . dicitis. How this is to be taken is stated at
the cnd os the Summary.

60. 27. deus ut...sit= ut esse statuatur. See note to c. 9, 21,
27, 25·

60. 30. durum, only because not yet in use; comp. Quintil. VIII, 3,
32. But the formation of both words is quite correct, like necessitas and
necessitudo, claritas and claritudo, and the forms cited by Gellius XIII,
3: suavitiata, sanctitudo, acardituda, acritudo, with suavitas dac. Also
a'urituda, plauittula, suavitudo, tardituda, vastitudo. See Ritschl. De
Fictil. Litter. (Berolin, 1853), p. 20.

96 61. 1. Innumerabilia. See above c. 20, 53.
