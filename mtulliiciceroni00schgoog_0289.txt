is a fact however that they relieve each other in leading the train-
[Schoemann reads una succedit ex iis and continues this noter] In the
Mss. uno has fallen out because of the foregoing um. It is difficolt 'to
believe that Cicero himself left out the subject of the sentence.

116 119. 25. [lam introduces something new; vero emphasizes itasmore
important than the preceding3 illa also calls attention to the points which
immediately follow defining it. So in ξ 127 init: Iam illo cemimus, ut dte.
In § 1321om introduces the last of a series, which is much less common.
Sections ¹3² and 141 are interesting for the use of the particles introducing

the several points]

the methods which the dog and the ibis make ⁸use of, but they devised the
application of these methods to the use of men. Cicero’s expressionis
elliptical; the thought would be more fully expressed as follows: quoe . . .
reperto sunt, lroec a bestiis qnoque fieri videmus: nom vomitione canes
dte. Comp. Pliny H. N. XXIX, 4: vomitiones quoque hoc animal homi-
nibus monstrasse videtur,· also Plutarch c. 20. — [For Atque Schoemann
reads At quom and refer to his Opusc. Ac. 111, p. 339] On illa. . . quod
see note on ΙΙΙ, 7, 173 and on nuper above c. 5, 14.-It is pretty gen·
erally admitted that dogs cure their indigestions by vomiting, which they
produce by eating grass3 and in general many beasts possess the instinct,
when they are siclt or wounded‚ of eating or doing whatever will cure
them; and so the purgationes of the ibis rnay be quite true. But we can
hardly believe what is next said of the panthers and wild goats, especially
the falling out of the arrows after the animals have eaten dictamnus. still
both circumstances are related by several ancient authors.

possess the property of producing bad odors when they are under the in-

plants.’' So very often the genus is subjoined to the individual or the
species by the simple copula ; as Pindarus novemque lyrici. . . nragni
Iovis et deorum nuntius ,· and similar examples in Burmann on Petron. c.
2. In the absence of a word embraeing the whole genus of vegetable
growths,- for planto denotes only slips, layers, 811, -Cicero either uses
stirpes, which properly denotes only the trunlr of the plant, or he adoptsa
circumlocution. As here, so in c. 33, 833 and similarly c. 10, 26 and 28.
