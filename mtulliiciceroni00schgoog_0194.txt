have written: quidest, cuius, cum principium aliquod sit, nihil sit extre-
mum? On this form of sentence in general see below note to c. 9, 23.
38. 29. si est [eadem] scil. ac Platonicus deus. Tire traditional read·
ing, Pronoea verosi vestra est, eodem requiro gives no adequate sense,
but has found some defenders.
38. 32. mortalem mundum. Comp. note to ΙΙ, 46, 118.

38. 33. Ab utroque, i.e. o te, Lucili, et a Platona-For the matter 3
itself see Lucret. V, 169 ff.

38. 34. exsilierint: i.e. prodierint od aedificandum.

39. 2. nam fatcor etc. Comp. Plat. Timae, p. 39 E: ἡμέρας γὰρ καὶ
νύκτας καὶ μῆνας καὶ ἐνιαυτοὺς οὑκ ὄντας πρὶν οὐρανὸν γενέσθαι, τότε ἅμα
ἐκείνῳ ξυνισταμὲνῳ τὴν γένεσιν αὐτῶν μηχανᾶται (ὁ δημιουργός.) ταῦτα δὲ
πάντα μέρη χρόνον. Saeculum, according to Censorin. d. die not. c. 17,
spatium vitaehumanae longissimum, partu et morie definitum. Origi-
nally therefore the span of life ς latera definite period of a hundred 01
a hundred and ten years ; sometimes too a longer period in general of no
precise limits.

39. 3. sed mundationem (non) potest. The connection of
thought, misunderstood by many, is as follows: Before the creation of the
world and the heavenly bodies there was an eternity without beginning or
division into periods; but of its duration (lit. of what sort it was in respect
to duration, spatio) we can have no conception. We can conceive only
measurable and limited time ; but this was a thing impossible before the
heavenly bodies existed, by whose movements tirne is measured and di·
vided. — The negation before potest is indispensable. Comp. Arist. Phys.
IV, 11 ; Sext. Emp. Pyrrh. hypot. 111, 140 f. Victorin. ad Cic. De Invent.
Ι, p. 79, Orelli.

39. 6. ut fuerit. We should expect ut fuisse intellegamus ,· the ab·
breviated forrn of expressionis not unfrequent. Comp. De Fin. Ι, 5, 14:
adduci vix possum, uteo tibi uon vera uideantur, for ut ea tibi uero esse
uon modom. De Legg. 111, 15, 33: ego in isto suni seutentio‚uil1ilut
fuerit iu suffragiis uoce melius, for ut fouisse putem ,¹ more examples of the
sort where a consequence only conceived is expressed precisely as an
actual one may be seen in Madvig’s note to the above passage De Fin,
and Haase notes to Reisig’sV01·lesungen,p. 557. Comp. also below c. 27,
75 and 34, 95. [The two examples cited by Prof. Schoemann are quite
dissimilar. After adduci there is plainly an ellipsis as it is commonly
explained. But with in isto sententia sum the explanation does not hold.
Iam not of the opinion that Ι think a thing is so, Ι am of the opinion that
it is so. So in Tusc. V, 41, 119: quorum ea sententia estut virtus per se
