natural one, so he passed unpunished to the funeral pile, inasmuch as his
body was not maltreated nor was the honor of burial refused him as was
customary in the case ot' criminals. —But impunitus is only a conjecture;
the Mss. have in T ympanidis rogum or rogo,· and it is possible that Tym-
panis was the name of the builder ol the costly funeral pile on which ac-
cording to the ancient authorities Dionysius was burnt. This is the opinion
of Welcher, Rhein. Mus. N. F. VI, p. 399. -atque stands in the place
ol an adversative conjunction ; a simple copula is often used where the
connectiones thought is plain ot' itself.

immediately below, ratione et disciplina, rational order and constitution.
The idea that the voice of conscience itself is only a mode os operation of
the divina ratio is designedly left out ol consideration by the Academic
sor purposes os the argument, although it might easily have suggested
itself and was by no means ignored by the wisest os the ancients.

164. 10. iacent omnia = omnia corruunt. It is the conscience alone,
Cotta means, that gives to life its solid basis, not the divine ordinance; for
we are precluded from recognizing such divine government when we see
that neither virtue is rewarded nor vice punished. Against this argument
see among others Plato Repub. X, 612. 6133 Simplic. on Epictet, p. 357
Schweigh3 and Sallust De Deis et Mund. c. 19.

164. 13. mundi [in homlnes] moderatio. The words in brackets
are an addition of some interpolator and are not only superfluous, hut vio·
late good usage.

plainly untrue. Homer in ll. Xlll, 730, and in other passages says that
all human endowments‚ even a right mind (νόος ἐσθλός), come from Zeus.
“ God alone is good,'' says Simonides, “and no one attains to virtue with·
out the help ol the gods ''; Sim. Fr„ p. 16 and 45, Schneidewin- ‘⁴ Zeus,
from thee come the great virtues to men‚'' says Pindar· lsthm. ΙΙΙ, 6.
“Men are good and wise through the deity‚” Pind. Ol. IX, 30· “The
greatest gift ol the gods is to be not evil-minded ’'; Aeschylus Ag. 927.
And Socrates in Plato's Phaedrus, p. 279 B prays to the gods to grant him,
that he may be inwardly beautiful and that his outward circumstances may
correspond‚ just as in several os the Homeric hymns the gods are invoked
to grant virtue and well being. Cf. Spanh. on Callim. h. in lov¹ 96. Ut·
teranees like these are found in any number (cf. Schoem. Opusc. Ae. Ill,
p. 108); and although there are in abundance others which could be cited
in support of Cotta’s argument, yet if we should count and weigh the suf·
