BOOK 11.-cnar. LIV, LV, ξς 134-136. 279

122. 24. depulsum . . . depellit. The use of the same word twice
at so short an interval, where it would have been easy to use, sor depellit,
perhaps deglutit, or sor depulsum, depressum (as Biinemann on Lact. De
opit. Dei, c. 10, 16 proposed), is evidently a fault which is only explained
by the haste and carelessness with which Cicero wrote this part of the book
devoted to anatomy, and ol which there are many other traces. Comp.
note on c. 58, 145· ⁴

122. 31. quodam operculo, the epiglottis, Gr. trepton-rte. See Gell. 131
XVII, 11 where various views are mentioned in regard to its use.

122. 33. alvi natura. Comp. De Fin. V, 11. 33; hoc intellegant, si
quando naturam hominis dicam, loncincm dicere 1111),Ι nillil enirn lroc dis·
sert: Lucret. I, 276: curn corollis aquae fertur ccotura repente flumine
obtendenti. It is easy to see that such a circumlocution would not be
everywhere admissible; it is only so where the object is considered in
respect to its natural constitution and purpose. —alvus means here the
stomach, but sarther on (multiplex et tortuoso) tlre bowels ; the term there·
sore includes both the ventriculus and the intestina. Alnus superioris
used for the stomach in Cato R. R. 156. Greek ἡ ἀνω κοιλία and ἦ κάτω
κοιλία.

122. 34. pulmones et eor . . . spiritum ducant. The part which
the beart was supposed to bear in the process ol breathing is given more
definitely below c. 55, 138. Itis ol course one of the many errors in this
part ol the book ; to note them all would require too much space and be
of little use.

123. 9. [The Mss. have in re spiritu which Lamb, Schoemann 11111165
Miiller correct to in respirotn, Madvig and Baiter to intrante spirita]
tum se contrahunt adspirantes tum 111 respiratu dilatant. Ahove
c. 54, 136 the word respiret is plainly used of breotliing ont, exhaling the air
already in the lungs; and lihewise below in § 138. Adspr'rare however
in cases where it seems to mean this really means only the hreathing upon
something, acaptare, adlralore, as De Div. 1, 36, 79, where the influences
are spoken os quaefiunt ex disparili adspiratione terrarum. Comp. ibid.
57, 130 ; and above c. 33, 83 adspiratio aeris where the point is not so much
the inkaling as the influence of the air which is necessary rothe growth
of animals in breathing and in other ways. Respirore too is never used
really for indaling as opposed to exloling, but only of breathing in gen·
eral, the spiritus reciprocatio (Gell. XVII, 11, 4) in which the others
alternate; or it means to recover the breath after the hreathing has
been for a time interrupted. In the present passage Cicero meant by ad·
spirantes only the breathing upon something. He avoided the word
