—While the sun revolves around the earth from East to West 365 times
and a fraction, it moves backward along the ecliptic through the twelve
signs from West to East; sometimes it approaches nearer to our orbis ler-

it goes sarther from it while moving downward to the sign of Capricorn.

94. 15. tum adeunt, tum recedunt. This, like antecedendo et re-
tardanda ξ 52, is to be taken in reference to the sun. All the planets, as
well as the sun, move through the Zodiac; at times they are nearer, at
times sarther from the sun3 sometimes they go before, sometimes after
it. Of course all this is to be understood of their apparent, not their real
motion.
