220 NOTES.

menter errat Timarchides, sed errat domestica coniectura ,· Ad Attic. XIV,
22, 1: vercor ne nihil coniectura aberrem. With aberrare of course
a vero, a proposito is to be supplied. A complete misunderstanding os the
expression has occasioned the placing of the preposition a before con·

iectura: and one must then imagine that coniectura can mean tlte very
truth that is souglrt ostem· as the latest desendet of this opinion says,
“ coniectura cum effectu'’ or “finis quo tendirrrus.”

62. 18. Et barbati quidem dte, “And of abearded Jupiter Ior-
sooth ’' &c This is represented to be quite as certain as what precedes, and
with a view of weahening or destroying its force as an argument. See
Schwarz on Hor. Turscll, p. 284; Jahn on Cicero Or. c. 50,168; aud
especially Madvig Emend. in Cic. Libr. Phil, p. 91.

101 62. 24. ob aliquam utilitatem. An assertion often made, but
hardly correct, at least in this general form. The worship of animals is a
sort of fetishism, testing upon avague feeling of a superhuman power of
nature as displayed in them, which man· in an uncultivated state wonders
at and reveres. In Plut. De 1s. et Osir. c. 74 the συμβολικόν is placed
along side of the χρειῶδες and in c. 77 animals are called αὶνίγματα τοῦ
θεοῦ. Comp. the learned remarks oi J. A. Kanne in the Introduction to
his Mythologie der Griechen, and Duncker, Geschichte des Alterthums I,
p. 53, 2d edition.

6228. volucris anguls. Other authors make the same statement,
but derive the winged serpents in part not from Lybia but from Arabia,
as Herod. II, 753 III, 1073 Ammian. Marcell. XXII, 15, 26. Schneider
on AElIan. II. An. II, 38 is of the opinion that the creatures in question are
flying lizards (the draco volans oi Linnaeus). The whole matter is doubt·
less exaggerated and fabulous. '

62. 28. vento Africo. For the italians the Africus is the West South·
West wind, ab occidente hiberno, qui apud Graecos λίψ dicitur (Seneca
Quaest. Nat. V, 16), because it came to them from the province Africa.
Here it must be a West wind, as Lybia lay in this directi⁰n from the
Egyptians.

6232. tamen beluas &c The connection of the sentences shows
that this is the true construction, not concludam tamen, because ita corcelu-
dam dre. is not opposed to, but rather follows from what goes bet'ore;
Cotta concludes thus, not although, but because he wishes to be brief. The
tantan points to a thought not expressly stated because easily supplied from
the connection, as often occurs in conversational style: Although people
laugh at the Egyptians for their worship of animals, yet the animals (and
this by way of excuse) are not considered sacred without some reason. -
