noos< 1.-cnn. xxv, xxva, §a 67-71. ²09

Pr0bably Epicurus did not say exactly what Cicero here states, but only
that the so-called principle exclusi tertii does not hold unconditionally,
inasrnuch as in alternative propositions referring to the future it is quite
possible that neither ol the alternatives rnay be true. Comp. Prantl, Ge·
schichte der Logilr I, p. 4033 and Zeller 111², 1, p. 391.

[Zeller 111¹, p. 233 thinks that Epicurus did not mean to impeach the
formal correctness ol the disjunction, but only the material truth ol the two
propositions. He did not deny then that of two contradictory cases one
or the other must occur, that the statement was true that ‘Epicurus will be
either alive or dead to-morrow '3 but he denied only the truth ol the two
propositions each taken by itself, ie. he denied the truth ot the proposi·
tions ‘Epicurus will live,' and ‘Epicurus will not live,’ because either one
becomes true only when the actual occurrence takes place]

52. 33. omnls sensus veri nuntios. Lucretius IV, 480 ff. gives
Epicurus's reasons3 namely that what is called illusion ol the senses is
not the fault of the senses themselves, but of a wrong interpretation of the
sensuous impression3 see ibid. 464 ff.

52. 34. Nlhll . . .nrmtsca1ndo for admodum or valde collide. So
non nimis for “not extremely.'’ Cic. Div. in Caecil. c. 22, 71 : Hoc statu·
ere, iudices, debetis, Caecilium non nimis laroc causam severe, non niniis
accurate, non nitriis diligenter acturum. Tusc. V, 33, 93: non nimis
sortasse subtiliter, utiliter tamem Acad. ΙΙ, 47,146: nec tomen nimis
eleganter.

53. 1. dum individuorum corporum concretionem fuglt. Epi· 71
curus did not deny that the bodies ol the gods consisted ol atoms; he
denied only the concretio, i.e. the thicker, more compact constitution of
their bodies. Comp. 27, 75. So lor example in ΙΙ, 39, 101 he opposes
concretus air to susus et extenuatus: crassum caelum atquc concretum II,
16 in.; pingue et concretum caelum, De Divin. Ι, 57, 1303 orinris concreti
humores, below ΙΙ, 23, 593 terrena concretaque corpora, Tusc. Ι, 18,
4²· But it is certainly untrue that Epicurus attributed to the gods this
finer, more subtle constitution ol body simply for the reason here assigned
by Cotta. See Summary, p. 26, n. 1 ; and lor the true reason see note to
c. 18, 49.

53. 3. sod tamquam corpus, sc. esse ait, supplied from the preceding
negot: as De Fin. V, 29, 88: Ille Metelli vitam negat beatiorem quam

Reguli, praeponendam tamenr a frequent ellipsis. So nolo. . . sed, c. 7,
17.

53. 4. Mirabile videturlloe. Comp. De Div. II, 24, 5¹ where this 2ss
sentiment is assigned to the elder Cato.
