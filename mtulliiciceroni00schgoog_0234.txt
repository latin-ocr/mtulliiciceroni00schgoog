same order and meaning it is also found in Verres I, 1, 21 ι si reticeat et
absit, tomen impudentiae suae pudentem exitum quaesisse videntum· Ad
F amil. XV, 17, 2 : Nos tric . . . tamen ad te scribam aliquid. . . Sullam
patrem mortuum habebamus.

62. 35. habet ior habent, see note to c. 19, 51. 1⁰2

63. 4. Haec oratio . . . spoliat, ie. what you say takes away from tt
the gods motion dre. In the same way De Leg. 1, 3, 10: Legationem
aliquam m'mirum ista oratio postulat; what you say indicates a wish ior
a legatio. Comp. II, 1, 3 and 10, init.

63. 10. actio vitae. See note to c. 17 45. 103

63. 16. quae igne nasci putentur, ie. by a socalled generatio ori·
ginaria, which the old natural philosophers held to be unquestionable.
Seneca Quaest. Nat. V, 6 says oi the animals mentioned here: ignis, qui
omnia consumit, quaedam etiam creat, et quod videri potest non simile
veri, tamen aerum est, animalia igne generari. And Pliny H. N. XI, 36:

In Cypri aerariis fornacibus ex medio igni maioris muscae magnitudinis
volat pennatum quadrupes,· appellatur pyralis, a quibusdam pyrausta.
Quamdiu est in igni vivit,· cum evasit longiore paulo volatu, emoritur. ’
In other connections pyroustae denote what we call millers.

63. 23. [Quicquid . . . attigeris, ulcus est. ulcus is a weak point, lot
an insurmountable difficulty. So De Orat. 2, 72, 292: malum vitiumque
causae] ⁸
6325. Sic enim dicebas, i.e. above c. 19, 49: but there Velleius 10⁶
says not speciem dei, but vien et naturam deorum, which is quite a
different thing. The species are taken cognizance oi by the mind through
the imagines which aflect it, although afterward iurther reasons are iound;
but the nature of the gods cannot, like their form, be known from imagi·

nes, but only be deduced by the reason, mente or cogitatione cerni: they
are according to Epicurus only λόγῳ θεωρητθῖ-

63. 26. neque eandem ad numerum permanere. This could only
mean that the divine forms do not remain the same but are variable in
respect to number ; that they therefore appear now in greater now in les·
ser number. But according to Epicurus there can be no question oi num·
ber in regard to the gods. Cicero perhaps wrote neque eam adnumerum
permanare, so that adnumerum would be taken in the sense given in the
note to ξ 49, ie. sic nt rzremerari possit, and permanare in that oi flowing,
the transitio oi the images. So far as concerns the language there would
be no objection to this; and in sact one Ms. has permanare, which would
oi course however have very little weight ii the sense were not in its lavor.
Lachmann also writes earn ior eandem in note on Lucret, p. 24, but retains

permanere.
