OTTA having finished the refutation of the Epicurean theology‚

Balbus begins his exposition of the Stoic doctrine. lle divides
his discourse (ξ 3), after the traditional custom of the Stoica into Ι
four parts: 1. proof of the existence of the gods; 2. explanation ¹

individual apparitions of divine beings‚ partly from the revelations
of the gods through divination and auspices (4-12). Next follows
a statement of the reasons assigned by Cleanthes for this universal
belief in the gods3 first, the revelations of future events; second,
