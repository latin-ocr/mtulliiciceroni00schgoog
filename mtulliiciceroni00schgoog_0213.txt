200 NOTES.

material, therefore the impressions in virtue of which the mind conceives
the ideas of the gods must proceed from something material; ie. the gods
must be material. But their matter must be of another and finer sort than
that of the objects which affeet our bodily organs of sense 5 otherwise we
should perceive them with these organs, which is not the case. Comp.
Lucr. V, 149. lt is this other, finer matter of the gods, which affects the
mind direetly without the interposition of the bodily sense-organs‚ that is
here called quasi corpus, quasi sanguis.

cussed, we give here the text of Schoemann‚ followed by his notes, adding
afterwards comments upon the text in the present edition. sch: Epicurus
...docet earn esse vim ct naturam deorum, ut primum non sensu, sed
mente cernantur, nec soliditate quadam nec ad numerum, ut ea qnae ille

innumerabilibus individuis existat et ad nos affluat, cum maximis volupta-
tibus in eas imagines mentem intentam infixamque nostram intelligentiam

reads cernantur, divides the passage at perceptis, reads qurom[que]‚ species,

is wanting in the hiss-non sensu sed mente. See above note on

pir. IX, 25.-neo soliditate quadarn &a Epicurus called the solid
bodies perceived by the senses στερέμνια, as distinguished from the eidoln,
ie. more attenuated atomic forms, which, similar in form to the solid
bodies, stream forth from them: ἀπόρροιαι τὴν ἑξῆς θέσιν καὶ τάξιν ὄιστη-
poisat, ἤνπερ καὶ ἐν τοῖς στερεμνίοις εἶχον, Diog. L. X, 46.-The bodies
of the gods are not στερέμνια, and the atomic forms which how from them
are, as Lueretius IV, 732 teaches, meiito magis tenuia textu, quam qooae
percutiunt oeulos visurosque lacessunt. These last have a coarser constitu·
tion, which Cicero denotes by soliditas: the divine atoms have not this
soliditas, cannot therefore soliditate quadam ceroti lilre the στερέμνια,-

come into the mind: Fluentium frequenter transitio fit visionum, ute
multis una videatur, from which may be inferred that Epicurus taught
