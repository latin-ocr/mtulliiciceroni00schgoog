ΤΙιε medius locus of the universe, which is therefore also the lowest (sce
c. 45, 110), is occupied by the earth, c. 36 init. Tlrat which falls upon it
from above is the various sorts of atmosplreric storms; that which riscs up
from it into the higher regions is the evaporations from it ; that which
moves around it is the heavens with the lreavenly bodies ; and by virtue of
these motions proceeding from, tending to, or encircling this general cen·
tre the world appears to be a coherent, uniform system, a continens ursaque
natura. [The real object of efficiunt, so far as the sense is concerned, is
contained in the adjectives continentem and unanc,· “these operations
make the continuity and unity of nature.'']

104. 22. vicissitudine eorum. The mutual transformation of the
elements here alluded to was taught before by the older natural philoso-
phers, like Heraclitus, who called it a ὁδὸς ἄνω κάτω, a rising and falling;
the fire (or ether) is condensed into air, the air into water, the water into
earth, the earth again becomes water, &c Senec. Quaest. Nat. ΙΙΙ, 103
Plut. De Prim. Frig. c. 143 Diog. L. IX, 9; comp. below 111, 12, 31.
Many propounded similar ideas, for which see ldeler on Arist. Meteor. 1,
p. 426; Schwegler on Arist. Metaph. Ι, p. 72.

104. 27. [coniunctio continetur. Such expressions are frequent:
curriculum circumscripsit, for dedit ,· terminabit modum, for ponet, saciet,¹
societatem coniungere, coire for facere &c See Nigelsbach Lat. styl,
r· 289]

104. 30. utrumvis ut sit. See c.46, 118. 8⁶

104. 30. natura mundum admlnIstr-arl. Cicero might properly
have omitted here the epithet sentiente, as he had already expounded the
Stoic idea of nature, and the verb administrari itself indicates a designed,
intelligent govemment. In what follows the epithet is sometimes ex-

pressed, sometimes omitted.
105.1. Etenim. The remark made c. 16 init. holds true here. 86

105. 7. semiustor et sator. The Stoics call the various manifesta-34
tions of the deity in the various parts of creation λόγοι σπερματικοί (see note
c. 30, 7 5) ; but the unity which lies behind all these and manifests itsels in
them is called in the singular λόγος σπερματικός, as creative reason. Diog.
L. VII, 136. Cicero translates σπερματικός by seminator et sator.

¹05· 18. ea fortuna. For the neuter see note on c. 5, 15. ῃ

¹05· 26. solarium discriptum a real sun-dial, because of the lines
drawn upon it, in distinction from the solarium ex aqrca, a water cloclr, the
etymological meaning being lost sight of. The former is also called by the
Greek name sciotherum or sciotltericon ,· the water clock is also called <iep-

sya'ra, and was originally extremely simple‚hut since the mesammones
