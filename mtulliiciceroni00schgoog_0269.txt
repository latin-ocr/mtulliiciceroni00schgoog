ἒξ 99. 5. inter mare et eaelum. The Stoic prefers to say “between
sea and sky,’‘ ie. aether, rather than “between earth and sky,'' because he
thereby at the same time intimares the intermediate nature of the air be·
tween water and ether. Comp. c. 39, 1013 45, 1173 Ps. Aristot. De Mund.
c. 33 and further in Balfour on Cleomed., p. 315 Bak.

99. 9. a iuvando. The derivationis hardly admissible. The name is
rather from the same root as Iovis, and to be compared with the Greek
Διώνη.

99. 10. ex fabulls3 according to the mythological sables, for which
it may suffice to refer to Hom. ll. XV, 187 ff.

99. 11. [Schoemann reads altero], old form for alberi. Comp. Reisig,
Vorles. ξ 121.

99.13. Neptunus. The comparison of this etymology with that oi
Portunus is curious enough. Itis quite possible that the name is related
to trare, but we must think on the signification os sto‘eoing, which the verb
has lost in Latin, but which the Greek νὰω and νέω retain. Τὴε forms vobo
(sor urio), the Fut. vcioouar or νευσοῠμαι, and ναῦς, navis, testify to the
digamma in these words. So then Nevitunus, Natum, Neptunus would
not be improbable, and the name would be οἱ the same root as the Greek
Νηρεὺς. Others compare it with the Sanscrit Naupati‚ the name given in
the Rigveda to the god os the overhanging cloud-heavens.

99. 14. Diti. The identification with ntalem is easily and often
made 3 whether correctly so is a question.

99. 16. Proserpina may be a corruption of the Greek Περσεφόνη, which
was introduced the more easily because in this form it reminded one of
proserpere, and seemed to point to the springing up of plants. The cx-
planation of the Greek name is uncertain. —The words nuptam dicunt
which have fallen out in the best Mss. stand in some after ttamen est.

67 99. 19. egerendis fruglbus Ceres. So Varro says too, L. L., V, 64,
but wrongly. The name seems rather to be related with Ceras manus,
cited from the Carmina Saliaria, and explained to mean creator bontas, from
the root cer, from which creo also comes. Comp. Corssen, Krit. Beitr. z.
Ram. Lautlehrc, p. 342. - That Δημήτηρ was the same as Γῆ Μήτηρ is an
error that prevailed among the learned Greeks, and has been obstinately
held by some moderns. Comp. Ahrens Dial. Dor, p. 80, and Kiihner‚
Greek Gr. 1², p. 122 (Germ. ed). It is equivalent to Δέα μήτηρ, goddess
mother. Δὲα is cited by Hesychius as the Tyrrhenian name of Rhea, like
the equivalent dea. This form also occurred in the Doric dialect; see
Grammat. Vat. at the end of Gregor. Cor, p. 692 Schaef.

99. 22. Mavors is to be connected with mas, erraris, which originally
was the same as mam this by reduplication became Mamers, and by
