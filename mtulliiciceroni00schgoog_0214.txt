that these images produce in the mind only a general conception without
distinction oi single individuals: and with this agrees the allusion in c. 29,
80 to the undistinguishable similarity of the gods. ad nanterum cerni
then is equivalent to ita cerni ut numerari singillatim possint ,· ior the
possibility oi couuting presupposes a power of distinguishing individuals.

bus propter similitudinem et transitionem perceptis. The transitio is
plainly the passing over of the images from the gods to the minds oi men.
But similitudo reminds one of the phrase similia similibus percipiuntur.
The divine images are of similar constitution with the partos the mind
affected hy thern, the niens animi (Luci-et. V, 149). Hence they are per·
ceived by the mind directly without the intervention oi the bodily eye.—
Quumque. Having first shown how the mind arrives at the general idea
os God, he shows secondly, how it acquires the conception of a happy and
immortal being—On que which, though wanting in the Mss, is indis·
pensable see note to c.¹ 10, 24.-1nf1n1ta species. The reason for the

i.e. atomis. Comp. c. 39, 109: innumerabilitas suppeditat aleatorum.-

praienotio or πρόληψις gained from rhe imagines excites the mind to refiect
on the nature of the gods (Gr. ἐπιβάλλειν, ἐπιβολῇ), and it thus arrives
at the idea of God as a happy and immortal being; and this as a conse·
