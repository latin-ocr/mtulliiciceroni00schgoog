metitus, religio. Pietas is pure, dutisul feeling towards those with
whom we stand in intimate connection, our relatives, colleagues in office,
our superiors3 especially then towards the gods as our governors and
benefactors. In 41, 116, it is described as iustitia adversum deos, and in
the same place sanctitas is called scientia colendorum deorum ,¹ (see also
the note). Sanctitas is properly irreproachable behavior towards the
gods; religio the recognition of the duty by which we feel ourselves
bound (De Invent. 11, 53, 161: quae superioris cuiusdam naturae, quam
divinam vocant, curam caerimoniamque (ιιᾷενὶ), and to this idea the
derivation from religare given by Lactantius IV, 28 appears to correspond
better than that of Cicero, from relegere, given below II, 28, 72.

33. 16. fictae simulationis. of course any simulatio is ficta ,· which
does not however prevent Cicero from emphasizing the idea by the added
epitheton.-More0ver the remark has particular reference to the Epicu·
rearis, who, although disbelieving in a divine power that governs the
world, yet endeavored to keep up an appearance of divine reverence. See
below, ch. 17, 45 ; 21, 563 and on the other side, 41, 115.

33.· 20. fides . . . lustltla tollatur. Cicero also points out the con· l
nection between the duties towards men and the duties towards God
in 11, 61, 153; but a passage cited by Lactantius V, 8 srorn the De·-
Legibus refers to the ground oi this connection, namely, that the con·
sciousness that all men are of the same (divine) race and are in the same
way the object of the divine love and care must produce among them too
a mutual regard and love. So in De Offic. 111, 6, 28 disregard oi one’s
duties to his fellow·men is brought forward as a proof oi impiety towards
the gods. Compare also below II, 61,153 and Gataker on Antonin. ΙΙ,
1, p. 43. Wyttenbach has observed not without reason that the clause
beginning atque haud scio would be in a more proper place before the
preceding quibus sublatis. In its present position it seems only an after·
thought, to make an application of the preceding general observation to
the living together ol nien in society. A radical criticism might be die·
posed to throw aside the whole clause as an interpolation; one less severe
to substitute namque ior atque. [But is not the clause haud scio an a
reinlorcement of the preceding? Cicero has just said that, if sanctitas
and religio are taken away, great trouble ensues in common life; but if
you take away pietus adversus deos, loyalty towards the gods, it would be
almost impossible ior men to live together in society]
