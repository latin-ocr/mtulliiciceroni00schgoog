88 63. 32. tantum modo ad cogitationem valent, because they make
no impression on the senses, but only on the mind, and so they simply give
rise to ideas.

ὑ 3. 34. talem conformationem auinri, that is, an idea not resulting
from any sensuous perception, but only from a mental act. arrimr' is geni·

Ti. Gracchus when tribune of the people proposed the deposition of his
colleague it. Octavius who had opposed him, and called on the people to

objects not only itnages of coarser consistency which are perceived by the
