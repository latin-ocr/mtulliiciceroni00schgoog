nersunnc . 331

In the last part of the passage the words mentem intentam infixamque
nostram intellegentiam capere are evidently to be understood not of the
simple contemplation or perception by the mens, but rather of the process
of reasoning which follows, examines and searches for the true purport of
our perceptions. Perception alone is only receptive and can naturally give
only the species deornm, as Cotta (§ 107) rightly remarks; but a percep-
tion that is only receptive and passive is not enough for the human mind 3
it is thereby roused to an individual activity. This is again of two kinds ι
first, so to speak‚ a cursory one, and the ideas which come from it spon·
taneously are very properly called προλήψεις, notiones anticipator, ante·
ceptae informationes (ξ 43). If they are sometimes called intellegentiae,
this is hardly done without an epithet to denote their nature, such as in·
elautae, adumbratae, obscurae, Cic. De Leg. 1, 9, 25 ; 10, 303 22, 59 (comp.
on De Offic. ΙΙΙ, 10, 76) ; in reality they are only opiniones (ᾗ 45); they
cannot become intellegentia but through more exact investigation and
rational foundation which the mind aims at while it 'is busy with them.
This is denoted by the Greek insititiam, ἐπιβολὴ (Schneider ad Epicur.
Physic, p. 65), and Cicero expresses it by animus se iniciens et intendem,
or, asin our passage, niens intenta infixaque.

Now if the intellegentia thus gained is spoken of as one qnae sit et
hato natura et aeterna it is plainly nonsense; and this is generally ac·
knowledged. The emendation I (Prof. Sch.) proposed in my Opusc.
Acad. IV, 347 Ι called paullo obscurior,· but it is not so obscure that it
might not be understood with a little thought. Bake’s quam sit ea beata
natura et aeterna (Mnemosyn. 11, p. 415) may be easier so far as the Mss.
are concerned; but one of the defenders of this reading has not over-
looked the fact that qnam cannot possibly be taken of the measure or
degree of happiness and immortality of the gods. He has recourse there·
fore to the assumption that the difficulty of the passage results from a rather
stupid misunderstanding on the part of Cicero. He thinks Cicero found
in the Greek original that he was translating ὥς, which there had the
force of ὅτι corresponding to “ that'' introducing a sentence 3 and that he
erroneously took this for the adverb equivalent to qnantum or quantopere.
lfCrcero had found ὡς in the original, he would have translated it by nt, as
he did in the phrase of Protagoras in c. 23, 63.

, On the law of Isonomy cited by Velleius in §50 as an argument for the
happiness and immortality of the gods Ι have expressed my doubts on p. 24.
lt Epicurus and the greater part of his followers did not make use of this Ι
law, it remains to inquire what other argument they did advance. There

ere no express data on this point and we can only form conjectures. We
