extremum the whole surlace or the whole circumference ; but imagined
two diametrically opposed points, one above the centre called summum,
the other below, which would have been more correctly called imum, not
extremum. In this case the error would only be that an expression which
might be applied to other bodies or figures is here applied to the sphere or
circle alone.

93. 18. oaell palatum. Probably palatum was originally “whatrs
covers like an arch,’' and hence could be used os the heavens that overarch
the earth, as well as of the palate that overarches the mouth. The Greek
οὐρανός also means both palate and heaven; and the same homonymy
is found in other languages, as J. Grimrn remarks in Haupt’s zeitschr. liir
Deutsches Alterthum VI, p. 541.

93: 26. easdem . . . opacet. It is incorrect tosay that the suu
darkens any part ol the earth. It leaves it in shade while it is shining on
the opposite side. So Horace improperly says in the Carm. Saec. 9: alme
sol, curru nitido diem qui promis et celas,· and when Pliny H. N. 11, 5, 4
says hic (sol) reliqua sidera occultat, illustrat, the illustrare can only
happen when the sun sets and so allows the stars to become visible. So
Livy XXXIII, 7, 9 says: iuga montium detexerat nebula, the mist, iu. by
passing away. Comp. below c. 40, 102. Similar examples in Reisig

earth, falling in any part of the heavens, banishes in a certain sense the
