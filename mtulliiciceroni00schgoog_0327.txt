143. 23. [ot quidem has the Mss. authority. Schoemann and Baiter
Iand ΙΙ read atque idem. The same Mss. have et quidem in ΙΙ, § 41,

{P 143. 32. Quid Chalcidico Euripo . ..constantius‘t There were
probably other opinions about this, for the irregularity of the currents in
the Euripus was proverbial. Comp. Plat. Phaed. p. 90 C. Diogenian.
Prov. 111, 393 IV, 72. There is however in this irregularity a regular

ordered by nature working blindly and unconsciously (see ΙΙ, 32, 81 note)
no more gives an explanation of them than he who sees in them the work·
ing of a divine law. Can one be proved any more than the other? Cotta
promises to bring the proof (quem admodum docebo, at the end oi the
chapter) ; but the passage in which he attempted it is lost.

ofpersons.
