asthe Stoic did one must rcmember that according to Chrysippus, from
whom this portion of the argument is doubtless directly or indirectly taken,
the thinking faculty resided in the breast, in the beart, and thus close to the
lungs. See Galen, De Hippocr. et Plat. Dogm. II, 3 sq.‚ and ΙΙΙ, 8. The
thought is formed here as λόγος ἐνδιάθετος and comes forth as speech, leiyos
προφορικός, through the organs of speech-Tbe Mss. have parcipitur
instead ospercietur [the reading in Schoemann's textJ.

127. 6. finita dentibus can hardly be right. Probably it should be
munita dentibus. See Opusc. Ac. ΙΙΙ, p. 377.

127. 6. vocem inmoderate profusam, the inarticulata sound; as on
the other hand moderatio vocis is used in De Leg. Ι, 9, 27 sor the articula·
tion. By means oi the articulation are formed the different and definitely
determined sounds, soni vacis distincti et pressi, the characteristic endow·
ment oi the μέροπες ἂνθρωποι, by which they are distinguished from tbe
beasts of which the vax is immoderate professa.

{33 127. 13. molles commissuras et anua “the movabie, pliant con·
nections and joints '’; for which he might have said commissuras artuum.
A rtus are really the same as articuli, Gr. ᾰρθρα, although the word is atter·
wards used lor the members oi the body; mollis is originally equivalent to
mobilis, from which it is derived; the meaning “soit ” is only a sec·
ondaryonc.

151 127. 24. condita is bere more probably from candere than from con·
dire. The salting and especially the conserving, condire, os alimentary
substances is usual only to a limited extent; the laying aside however,
candere, is genera13 and the most important substances, the grains and
vegetables, need no conserving. Comp. too c. 62, 156 and 63, 157.

127. 25. vescimur . . . capiendo is an inexactness oi expression worth
noticing, sor quas capimus, alimus or quae capiuntur, aluntur.

127. 31. [ferrum eligimus3 Mss. elicimus. So in 130. 26 for reme·
dia eligamus the common reading is eliciamus. ln Tusc. ΙΙΙ, 5 83 stirpes
aegritudinis. . . eligendae srerztand in ΙΙΙ, ᾖ 84 fibrae stirpium . . . eligendae
sunt the reading os the Mss. eligendae is now accepted instead of the corn·
mon elidendae. ln Div. ll, ξ 149 where the common reading was super·
stitionis stirpes ornnes eiciendae Madvig and Baiter adopt eligendae.
Miiller proposes to read elr'ginrm and eligamus in our text; the last is in
fact the reading os lis. Λ; the former has no llis. authority]

127. 32. venas penitus abditas. These words form the second
hali of a trochaic tetrameter, and it is quite possible that not only here but
in Dc Offic. ΙΙ, 3, 13 Cicero had in mind a passage from some poet. Still
the mette may have been only a matter oi chance. Comp. note c. 9, 255
