consider as the πέμπτη obolo, quinto notura or quinta essentia (Macrob.
in Somn. Scip. Ι, 14, 20) the oetier, i.e. the fine etheric substance of
which according to Aristotle the heavenly bodies consisted, which sur·
rounded and penetrated the universe and formed according to many the
substance of the soul. According to Plato however, who takes the αἰθὴρ
only for the higher, finer air (p. 58 D), the soul comes neither from this
nor from any mixture or combination ol the five forms of matter (comp.
Trendelenburg's note to Arist. De Anim. Ι, 2, 7, p. 228) ; and all that the

earlier commentators have advanced to explain the traditional reading in
the text, od animum efficiendum, is quite untenable. The correct reading
is afficiendum. For Plato explains in detail, p. 64 Α 10 68 C, how the dif-
ferent moditications and nrixtures of the elements are adapted to affect the
organs of sense and by means of these the soul (τὸ φρόνιμον, p. 64 Β) and

to produce sensus, ie. perceptions.-Sensus, not senses but perceptions,
as often elsewhere 3 comp. Acad. l, 11, 40: Zeno sensus esse censuit o
quodam impulsione oblato extrinsecus-pariendos aeneus, like dolo·
rem parere, De Fin.I,15 end3 somnum parere, Plin. Hist. Nat. XIX,
8, 38.

38. 21. Longum estad omnia 3 dicere is omitted as in Tusc. ΙΙΙ,
18, 40: sed non necesse est irurzc omnio,· ibid. IV, 20, 46: exspecto quid
od isto sc. di'clurus sis,· and often elsewhere-od aliquid dicere, to
spealr against something. De Div. ΙΙ, 3, 8: dicendum est milii od ea,
quoe o te dicta sunt. Comp. below ΙΙ, 1, 1.

ao 38. 22. Sed illa palmaris [Schoemann’s reading sor palmaria],
“worthy of the palm,'' ie. the prize of victory; ironically of course. But it
is very doubtful whether Cicero really wrote thus, supplying mentally
sententio from ξ 18, or res (as Zumpt thinks, od Verria, p. 297 and
p. 700). Perhaps he wrote: sed illud palmare est, or illa palmaria as
Baiter and Madvig prefer; for although Plato's assertion is a single one,
yet it might have been made several times and in several sentences
(p. 32 C, 33 Α, 41 Λ) and so be indicated by a plural.

38. 26. physiologiam, not what is called so now·a·days, but natural
science. Cornp. De Div. Ι, 41, 90: naturae rationem, quom physiologiam
Graeci appellant. — lloreovcr Plato (Timaeus, p. 41, A) expressly recog-
nizes the law which Velleius reproaches him with being ignorant of ; but
he still ascribes to the highest God, the creator of the world, the power of
endowing what he has created with eternal existence.

38. 28. quid est . . . nlhll slt extremum Ἰ The question, equiva-
lent to a negation, relates properly only to the second number of the sen·
tence, cuius nihil sit extrenrum .· the first, cuius principium aliquod sil,
gives the circumstances under which that question is asked. Cicero might
