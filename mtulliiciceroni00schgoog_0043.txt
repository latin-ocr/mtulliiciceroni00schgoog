The other reproach made against Epicurus, that he did notin
reality believe at all in the existence of the gods, plausible as it is,
we may reject as unfounded. lt is quite true that there was no
place for the gods in his atomistic physics; andis he had contented
himself simply with explaining the origin of the world and natural
phenomena, he might or must have passed over the gods in silence,
as in fact he really does in the letter to Herodotus (Diog. L.. X,
45 ff.) which contains a short outline of his physics3 it is only at
the end that he characterizes the notion ofa government of the
world by happy and immortal beings as inadmissible. He wished

j however to explain psychological phenomena‚ the facts presented by
² the mind itself3 and finding the belief m the godsa κοινὴ εννοια or
³ πρόληψις (see note one. 16, 43), that' 1s, aconception generally
prevalent, and, as it seemed‚ one naturally suggested. he found him·
self obliged to enter upon the subject. But his system recognized
no empty and purely subjective pictures of the fancy3 every concep-
tion of the mind must necessarily have come to it from outside,
and thatin such a manner, that the atomic pictures affected the soul
either mediately through the senses‚ or immediately without their
intervention. He could not then explain the conception of the
gods as an empty figment of the fancy; it must have been due to
the action of atomic pictures upon the soul; and as the gods plainly
are not perceived with the physical senses, it resulted that the soul
must be directly affected by those pictures. But he was precluded
from explaining these as coming up by chance (for such pictures
there were) because of their continued uniform repetition3 this was
explieable only on the supposition that they proceeded from an
object having real existence. Hence the gods must have a real ex·
istence. Furthermore since the κοινὴ ἔννοια represented the gods as
happy and immortal‚ and this conception was warranted hythe law
of isonomy‚ they must then in reality be so. Furthermore, because
they not only differed from all other worldly beings in their immor·

tarny, but also because of their happiness they could not possibly
have anything to do with the world and the cares sor worldly things,

other writings: his last directions in regard to the ἐναγίσματα (Diog. L.,X‚ 18)
shows very well that he had not such unlimited confidenee in his philosophieal
doctrines as to consider the traditional customs os religion quite uureasonable.
