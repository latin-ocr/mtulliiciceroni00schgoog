4015. [Anaximandrh also 01 Miletus, an ionic philosopher, born
about rae. 611. He held the existence of a primeval substance, ἀρχὴ,
which he called ἄπειρον. It was undefined in quality and unlimited iu t
extent. There is a difference 01 opinion whether he considered the ἄπειρον
10 be a mixture 01 all the elementary substances which in time separated
and assumed distinct existence, 01 an indefinite substance which poten·
tially contained all the others. Aristotle, Phys. ΙΙΙ, 4, says that he
taught that the ὰπειρσν was itsels divine, contained and governed every·
thing. Ι1 is probable however that Anaximander did not express himself
very clearly on these points. He is said to have taught that the soul was
oi the nature 01 air. See Ueberweg, Gesch. der Phil. 1, p. 36.] -na·
tivos esse deos, asse. that the gods had not always existed, but had come
into existence in the course 01 the development 01 the universe. Comp.
Schwegler on Arist. Metaph. XII, 2, 5, p. 239.

40. 16. Innumerabffls mundos. Apparently not only the heavenly
bodies are here meant, which, as we know, Anaxagoras held to be gods,
bnt other worlds like our own. Comp. Stobaeus, Eclog. I, p. 4963 August.

aa 40. 18. Anaximenes, likewise 01 Miletus and 01 the Ionic school
like Thales and Anaximander, whose disciple he is said to have been.-
aera. He held the doctrine 01 an elementary substance like the air,
which he considered, as Thales did water and Anaximander the ἄπειρον,
1101 as mere liseless matter, but as endowed with living force. Stobaeus,
Ι, p. 56 says also that he called it god—eumque gigni. The statement
that Anaximenes held the airy elementary substance to have been created,
not to have existed from eternity, is doubtless an error, difficult to under·
stand or excuse. ex eoque onznia gigni would be a more correct statement
(Stobaeus, p. 296); but that is not to be thought 01 here.

11 40. 22. Anaxagoras 01 Klazomenae, also of the Ionic school (tae.
500), lived nrrd taught along time at Athens. 11 is very doubtful whether
Cicero and others are right in calling him a disciple 01 the preceding.

40. 23· primus . . .volu1t. Anaxagoras passes 101 the first philoso-
pher who rose to the idea 01 a pure, immaterial spirit. It is certain that
he held the existence 01 a νοῦς, which as a thinking, moving and regulating
principle he opposed to the orIginal matter that contained in itseif all the
constituents 01 the physical world, the so·called ὁμοιομερῆ, and believed
the two to be essentially different. He called the νοῦς λεπτότατον πάντων
χρημάτων nui redonemur, expressions which may be due to the want oia
more appropriate designatiou 101 what is purely immaterial (ἀσώματον, see
