but corresponds to etiam, as Cicero sometimes uses it, at least in the philo·
sophical writings and in the letters. Comp. Hand II, 513, 5175 aud
Kiihner's note to Tusc. ΙΙΙ, 13, 28. After speaking previously of the form
under which the gods are conceived he passes on to their various appel·
lations. For the indicative in this form of question compare above c. 29,
80 (arbitramur) ; belowc. 32, 90 (putamus) and further Madvig on Cic.
De Fin. II, 23, 76; and Opusc. Acad. alt, p. 41.

57. 2. in pontificiis sc. libris. These are the so-called Indigiti-
menta, quae et nomina deorum et rationes ipsorum nominum continent.

57. 3. istud . . . ita. Comp. De Divin. II, 8, 21: quod certe vobis ita
dicendam est,· and more in Hand Tursell. ΙΙΙ, p. 485. [De Fin. Ι, 7, 26 :
quod tibi ita videri neccsse est: II, 9, 28 : cur id non ita fit? V, 26, 77 r
quodnisi ita efficitur]

57. 7. ipsurn sibi displicere. tibi would have been more exact,
but what precedes really applies not so much to Velleius, as to the Epica-
reans in general.

[Haec vestra sunt. There seems to be something wrong here.
Cotta has just finished his refutation of the Epicurean doctrine that the gods
have human forms; he asts, l. 7, Απ tu mei similem putas esse aut tui
decim? and answers himself, Profecto non putas. He then asks, Quid
erg0?—do you think the sun and moon are gods? and shows this to be
absurd. Then according to the common reading he says, Haec vestra sunt.
But these doctrines last mentioned are not Epicurean doctrines, vestra, ir.
of Velleius and his sect. Then in the next sentence he goes on: ΙΙ they
have not human forms, as Ι have shown, nor any such forms (tali aliquo),
which you are quite certain of dic. The words nec tali aliquo refer to
solem attilanam aret caelum: but they must refer to some view which Vel·
leius did not accept as true ; and the words Haec vestra sunt state the con·
trary of what would be expected. Possibiy they should be a question; or
is the reading of the Ms. Ι (ed. Moser) the true one, Haec vera suntt]

57. 12. humano (visu)=trumana specie. As the Mss. here have a
break, the word to be inserted is by no means sure, it might be corpore.
But the emendation vriieraiites for nunterantes is certain.

57.17. ltaque tire. It is clear that the simple quotation in this sen·
tence is not properly that which is to serve as proof of the view just men·
tioned in the preceding, but that such proof consists in the supposed
intentional amlriguity of Epicurus, which is afterwards spoken of. This
connection of thought would have been more properly expressed as fol·
lows: ltaque crini in illis selectis eiiis brevibusque sententiis. . ,prima
sententia sit . . . in tac ita exposita sententia dra-On the κὺρ. ott. see
