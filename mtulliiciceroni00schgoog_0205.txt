192 NOTES.

[“ The distorted conceptions of the Platonic doctrines, which we lind
here, are not to be laid to the charge of Cicero, but to that of some Greek
authority of the Epicurean school, who, it would seem, designedly for his
own purpose expounded the Platonic tecchings and in part misrepresented
them.” R. Kiilrner, Wesen der Giitter, libers. u. erkl, p. 64]

11 42.1o. [Atque etiarn here and below§ 32 serves only to make the
transition. It is worth while to notice the different particles used for this
purpose throughout the whole passage from § 25. Compare a similar
one, Il, 47, 122.]

42. 12. formam del quaeri non oportere. Xenophon, Memor.
tv, ι, 13·

4²· 13. solem et anlmum deum. In the Memorabilia the sun is
nowhere called God3 and of the soul it is only said τοῦ θείου μετέχει.

42.13. inodo unum, tum autern plures deos. lt is true that
Xenophon sometimes uses the plural oi θεοί, sometimes the singular ὁ θεός,
τὸ θεῖον, also τὸ δαιμόνιον ; buthe uses the singular, as all other writers do,
only to designate the divine power in general, not this or that particular
god. An especial designation of a supreme God governing and maintain-
ing the world, as opposed to the other gods, is found only in IV, 3, 13, a
passage which is considered without reason by some critics as an inter·
polation, though an old onc.

4214. [suntiisdem ln erratis. We say in English that a person
is in crror; but here we must translate by the adjective. So below § 37:
nragno iu errore sententia est,· De Fin. ΙΙ, 14, 47: Atque his tribus gene·
ribus hortulorum notatis quarlmu sequitur ct incudem pulchritudine et
apium ex illis tribrcs,· a similar use in Tusc. Ill, 18, 42: Quae sequuntur

in cadem sententia ιιιιιί &c.]

13 42. 15. Antisthenes of Athens, disciple of Socrates, founder of the
82 Cynic school. In the Herculan. Fr. of Philodemus, p. 21 (72 Gomp.) we
find: παρ’ Ἀντισθένει ri ὲν τῷ φυσικῷ λέγεται τὸ κατὰ νόμον εἶναι aromata
θεοὺς, κατὰ ὑὲ phora iro. llis speculations in natural philosophy led him to
the idea of one God, at the same time that he allowed the traditional gods
of the popular belief to pass for creatores and subordinate servants of the
supreme God, just as other philosophcrs did. The judgment therefore
that follows, :allia ιιὶιιι et araturam dautem, is to he regarded as unfounded.
42. 18. Speusippus, lilrcwise of Athens, and successor of his uncle

Plato in the Academy.
42. 18. vim quandam . . .eamquo animalem. An animal, i.e.a
living force, asoul of the universe. From Stob. Ecl. I, p. 58 taken
with Arist. hletaph. 1111, 7, ξ 19, p. 1072 we learn that he called this
