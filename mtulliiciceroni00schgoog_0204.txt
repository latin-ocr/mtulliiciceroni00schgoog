views afterwards cited which Plato sets forth in other places. Conse·
quently Cicero should have made the clauses, in which these views are
stated, also dependent on the relative qui, opposing them to what precedes
by tamen: for example, qui in T imaeo (or qui, cum in Timaeo)...
censeat, alibi tanten sine corp. tec. [The opposition seems to be rather
between qui in Timaeo. . . censeat and the sentence beginning [dein et
in Timaeo. Cicero says that in these two dialogues Plato holds that
nothing can be known of the Deity, and yet in the very same dialogues he
says that various things, tacendum, caelum, astro dre. are God. Compare
what is said of Xenophon in the next passage: sacit Socratem disputan·
tem sormam dei quaeri non oportere, eundemque et solem et animum deum
dicere dcc. The clause Quod vero dcc. merely mentions in passing another
notion of Plato on the same subject]

this as an interpolation as Baiter and Heindorf do. The corresponding

impossible for an incorporeal being.

it by the highest God, the δημιουργός. Comp. note to c. 14, 37.

dwells in them. ⁴

Plato allowed the gods of the popular belief, as he had no reason to deny
their existence, to pass for creatores and servants of the supreme God.
