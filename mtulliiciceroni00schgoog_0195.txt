182 NOTES.

ipsa nibil valeat, the clause with ui is the plain statement of the opinion.
Talae the example in Fam. XV, 15, 2: equidem fateor meam coniecturam
banc fuisse ui-commuai saluti consuli vellent,· was his conjecture that
he conjectured so and so? De Fin. II, 3, 6: Hoc vero optimum, ut is . . .
nesciat. De Div. ll 2, 52 Magnificum illud. . . ut. . . non egeant. Tusc.
IV, 47: ita enim desirati, ut perturbatio sit &c., not a result, but the sub·
stance of the definition, censet. . . esse. Fam. XV, 2, 8: bac opinione ut. ..
liberarit. In all these cases the ut clause does not express a result, but
merely the idea in a simple sorm as a conception, without regard to the
actual reality. In the text the sense is: The idea is inconceivable that
there was ever any such thing as time when there was no means os meas·
uring it. The usage is doubtless an extension of the consecutive ut, but
is sufficiently common to be noticed apart]

22 39.11. signls et luminibus. The second word is in a measure
explanatory ol the first; lor regna are here the heavenly bodies, as it
were lights of heaven, as below c. 13, 35. Lucr. I, 1088: atque ideo
totrrm circumiremere aethera segnis. Signa is especially used of the con·
stellations of the zodiac, asin 11, 20, 52.

39. 12. tamquam aedilis, because the aediles had the care of deco·
rating the public places on sestive occasions. That illuminations were
included is not especially stated, but may be-reasonably inserted.

23 39. 17. ut fero dleitls. Comp. II, 53, 133 and 62, 154.

39. 19. An stultorum. They are immediately alter called improbi,
because improbitas springs lrom stultitia or insipientia, i.e. the want of
that proper insight and ol moral consistency in action, which belongs only
to the sapiens. According to the Stoics there is no middle term between
sapientia and stultitia (comp. De Fin. IV, 19); and as wisdom is attained
only by a very few, the great mass ol men are stulti or improbi—For
cum omnes stultl sint miserrimi comp. ΙΙΙ, 32, 79.

39. 20. [delude quid est adsecutus ’ἲ The deinde occurring three
lines below is at first a little conlusing. Velleius says that these things
were not created lor the sake stultorum lor two reasons: first (at pri·
nrum), because there was no occasion lor the Deity to show any favor to
the wiclted (improbi or sitelii); second, (deinde quid est adsecutus ?) be·
cause it has been of no avail if he did. The answer nibil is to be under·
stood alter adsecutus. This answer is now justified on two grounds: first,
(cum orienes bre.) because the stulti are already as wretched as they can

be lrom their own stultitia ,· second, (deinde quod ita nialla sunt bac.)

because ol the many ills ol lile fic]
3923. ut ea saplentes tre. The consequence ot the clause ita
mulla sunt incommoda is really contained in the second ol the two clauses
