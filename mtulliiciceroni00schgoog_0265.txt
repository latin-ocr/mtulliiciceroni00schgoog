with which it revolved. The clearest exposition of the matter is given by

1111111111 denotes a mode ο1 operation constant, definite and designed,
as also below c. 32, 81. In distinction l'rorn this πῦρ τεχνικόν Zeno called
the earthly lire πῦρ ἄτεχνον, as Balbus above c. 15, 41 called it consector et
consumptor omnium. Stobae. Ecl. 1, p. 358. From another point ο1 view
AEschylus (Prom. v. 7) calls it πάντεχνον because ol its usefulness sor
various arts.

96. 5. magistrum artium reliquarum. Apuleius (De Mundo,
Tom ll, p. 134 rlltenb.) expresses the idea involved in this as follows:
Num quid, oro te, ornatum atque ordinatum videri potest, quod non ab
epsius (mundi) exemplo imitatura sit ratio? All artistic effort is a cre-
ation with intelligence and design after the example of nature, which
erentes with intelligence and design. Omnis ars est imitatio naturae,
Senes. Ep. 65.

96. 6. omnls natura3 every force of nature, acting in any portion of
the universe or in any single being, in contrast to the natura ipsius mundi,
the universal nature working throughout the universe. Comp. c. 1ο, 28.

less than the latter 3 artificiosus may be said of one who has a high degree
of skill without being a thorough artist, an artist by profession3 the latter
is the artifex, the artist in all that he undertakes.

introduce not only parallel but contrasted expressions. (See Goerenz on
De Fin. l, 1, 3.) As on the one hand the nature ο1 individua] beings is
bound up in and conrlitionerl hy their 1111111111, their germs in which the
law ο1 their development is contained (in seminibus vis inest eorum
rerum, quae ex iis prorogarentur, De Div. Ι, 56‚128)‚ so on the other
hand universal nature follows her own free and rational determination.
