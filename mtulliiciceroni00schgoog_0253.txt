demonstrative refers to the ideas of sapientia, beatitudo, aeternitas con·
tained in the preceding adjectIves. See above Ι, 29, 80.
tt 8513. urguet angustius, “posses on with a closer, more concise
reasoning toward hIs result.'’ Urguere denotes the emphatic persistence
in an assertion or an argument by which the assent of others is compelled.
So De Fin. IV, 48, 77: urguent taurea et nihil remittunt, where Cicero
is speaking oi the argumentation oi the Stoics by which they tried to com·
pel assent to their proposition: artenia peccata paria—The following
argument of Zeno is also found in his own words in Sext. Emp. IX, 101.
85. 20. modulate, “melodicusly,” with melody3 numerose, “ rhyth-
mically.”
85. 24. [idem, Baiter 11, itera]

9 85. 28. dixeram. For the pluperfect see Haase’s note to Reisig, p.
5o4; Jahn on Orat. 29, 101.-motu suo, ie. matu proprio,· it is αὑτο-
κῐνητον, not set in motion or activity by anything external to itself.

86. 2. [extincto calore occidlmus lps13 ipsi, “we ourselves,” as

24 86. 3. Quod quidem Cleanthes . . . docet, quanta vis insit. A
sort of epexegesis similar to that noticed in I, 15, 38; iot here also the
relative refers to what precedes as object oi docet, the same idea being
afterwards repeated in another form, qeeatzta vis insit. Comp. De Fin. II,
4, 12: Quod vestri quidem vel optime disputant, nihil opus esse erem, qui
futurus sit philosophus, scire litteras ,· Corn. Nep. Attic. c. 18: nragistratus
earum non atriplius patinis versibus descripsit, quod vix credendum sit,
tantas res tam breviter potuisse declarari ,· comp below c. 37, 93, and fur·
ther Jahn on Orat. c. 16, 52. The frequent combinations quod si (above
c. 1, 3, below ΙΙ, 38, 96), quodcum, quodquoniam and the like have
sprung from this form of expression, although a freer use often obscures
the orIgin.

86. 5. quinis. Comp. note ΙΙΙ, 13, 34.

86. 6. venne ct arteriae. The second expression serves to specily
the first, sor it is only the arteries, not the veins, that beat ; but vena is
very often used in a generic sense including also the arteries ; and hence
one may say vetrae micant, vertas tangere and the like, though Gellius
XVIII, 10 ccnsures this as a loquendi imperitia. Comp. note 55, 138.-
[quurn eor· . . . palpitaret is acurious soi-m of expression 3 we should
expect ito mobiliter palpiiture with quum . . . evulsum in the form of an
