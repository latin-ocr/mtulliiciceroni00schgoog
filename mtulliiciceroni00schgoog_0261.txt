ts 92. 21. minimeque resipiens patriam, ie. Atticam. Attici praeter
ceteros in facetiis excellunt, Cic. De Orat. II, 54, 217. On resipere comp.
Gellius III, 3: Non dulium est, quin istae fabulae resipiant stilum Plau·

18 92. 32. noll prae te ferre, ‘⁴ don't make a parade” as if it were
something to boast os, and not rather to be ashamed ol.

92. 33. conum tibi als &c See I, ro, 24.

92. 34. [Novum etlam oculorum judlclum, ie. your sense of sight
seems to be differently constituted from that os other people, as well as your
mental judgmenh]

9²· 35. Sed sint lsta pulchriora... The contrast to this conces-
sion does not come until ξ 48, and then in a disserent form. Except lor the
intermediate sentences Cicero would have continued somewhat thus: illud
tamen certe nranifestum est, leam aequabilitatem motus &c

92. 35. dumtaxat aspectu, “at least sofar as the appearanceis
concerned,'' taking this only into consideration. Comp. Madvig De Fiu.

93. 1. [ea figura. ΤῙιε Stoics, in agreement with Aristotle, imagined
the universe to be a globe consisting of several concentric sphcres, which
with the earth were held fast in space by the force os gravity. Diog. LVII,
140: ἕνα τὸν κόσμου εἶναι πεπερασμένον, σχῆμα ἔχοντα σφαιροειδές· πρὸς γὰρ
τὴν κίνησιν ἁρμοδιώτατον τὸ τοιοῦτον. K'dhner.]

93. 5. globus (sio enim σῷαῖραν interpretari placet). The lan·
guage seems to indicate that globus in the mathematica] signification was
not yet generally in use in Cicero's time. He uses it sor the heavenly
sphercs in Somn. Scip. c. 43 of the earth ibid. c. 6 and Tusc. 1, 28, 69.
Originally it meant only a “ lump‚’' akin to glomus, as Priscian I, 8, 44 re·
marks. Seneca Quaest. Nat. IV, 11 and often in other places, as well as
Pliny several times, uses pila in speaking of the earth.

93. 8. a medloqne tantundem absit dre. [Schoemann has the
old reading a medioque tartham absit extremum, quantum idem a summo ,¹
quo nihil &c.; and wrcstlcs with it in the following note] The extreme
(extremum) os the sphere or circle is the whole surface or circumference3
and if one were to spccify arry point as the “highest '' (summum), this
would necessarily lic on the sur-sace of the sphere or in the circumferente
ol the circle, and could not be opposed, as is here done, to the extremum.
Is the passage is not corrupt, we must assume that Cicero did not mean by
