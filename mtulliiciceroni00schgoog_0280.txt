108.10. Aristoteles. No passage corresponding to that quoted in uo
the text is found in the extant writings oi Aristotle3 yet Sext. Enrp. IX, 22
cites the following passage oi his: θεασάμενοι γὰρ μεθ’ ἡμέραν μὲν bitror
περιπολοῦντα, νύκτωρ δὲ τὴν ebrarrov τῶν biimo ἀστέρων κίνησιν, ἐνόμισαν
eivai τινα θεὸν τὸν τῆς rotatim( κινήσεως καὶ εὐταξίας αἰτίαν. lt was proba·
bly irorn the dialogue περὶ φιλοσοφίας mentioned above Ι, 13, 33; 11, 15,
42. 44.

108. 32. quaecum viderent. [Schoemann reads baec ior qieae, and
says] the Mss. all have quae cnm uiderent. Ii Cicero really wrote thus,
he must in his haste have lost sight oi the construction oi the sentence,
which is in itseli not impossible. It is still quite as probable that he wrote
neither baec nor quae, and that the words cum viderent went with immu-
tabilis cursus, and that the conclusion oi the sentence commenced with
profecto. That is Madvig's opinion. [hliiller prefers to suppose that at
the end oi so long a passage Cicero changed the construction and wrote
quae than that the copyists changed baec into quae, or themselves interpo-
lated the quae. Baiter II brackets the quae]

108. 35. quondam eruptione Aetnaeorum ignium. Itis impos-{g
sible to ascertain which oi the various eruptions oi AEtna is here alluded t03
the notices oi the ancients in regard to them are collected by Cluver. Sicil.
Ant. 1, 8, p. 104 ii.

109. 15. horae, ie. horarium or horologium. It would be difficult to 97
find other examples oi boras in this signification, except perhaps in the
expression ad boras mittere, Cic. Brut. c. 54, 200: “to send some one to
look at the clock'’; Petron. c. 71: boras inspicere. The words attachi-
natione quadam show that a hydraulic clock is alluded to.

109. 24. ipsa ln sese nutibus suis conglobata3 gathered into thegg
sbape oi a ball by reason oi the tendency oi all its parts towards the cen·
tre. Comp. c.45‚ 116: omnibus eius partibus in medium vergentibus.
The same explanation oi the spherical form is oiten found also in other
places, as eg in Arist. De Caelo ΙΙ, c. 14. Others derived it from the revo-
lution oi the heavens around the earth ; Plin. H. N. 11, 64: intraturum
eius globum in fornacem orbis assidua circa eum mundi volubilitate cogente.
Comp. Bake on Cteomed„ p. 276, and ldeler on Arist. Meteor. I, p. 497.

109. 26. insatiabili varietate, i.e. qatae numquam uos satiat, that
never causes satiety and annoyance. So c. 62, 155: insatiabilior species,-
Fr. Hortens. Orell. IV, 2, p. 482 : caeli signorum adntirabilem ordinem in-
satiabilemque pulchritudinem magis spectat. Other examples ol adyeetwes
oi this terminatioa in active signification are animabitis above c. sinui xm
