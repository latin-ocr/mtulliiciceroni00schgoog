losophers of his time, vel princeps disciplinae Stoicae (De Div. 1, 3, 4),

viated in many points from the views oi the older heads of his school.

117. 4. ut . . .omn1s muudus ignosceret. Heraclitus had already
held ἕνα εἶναι κόσμον, γεννᾶσθαί τε αὑτὸν ἐκ πυρὸς nai πάλιν ἐκπυροῦσθαι

Stoics, like Heraclitus, held the existence of au original fiery element (the
στοιχεῖον κατ’ ἑξοχὴν according to Chrysippus in Stobae. Ecl. Ι, p. 312),
namely the ether, which they also called sire, though they distinguished it
irorn the coarser earthly fire; moreover they believed that the universe
which had originally been developed from this element would return to it
again, and atter that corne forth from it anew. Comp. Diog. L. Vll, 141

the easier because of the intervening dubitare dicebant.
