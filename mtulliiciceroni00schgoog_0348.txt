the murder of his colleague Drusus see c. 32, 80. Nothing more is known
of the poisoning of Metellus.

163. 1. Phalarin, tyrant of Agrigentum in Sicily about 5 50, of whose aa
crnelty many incredible stories are told, a part of which are evidently in·
ventions. He was finally put to death by the citizens of Agrigentum who
rose against him; the accounts vary as to the manner of his death. See
Beier on De Offic. II, 7, 26. -Apollodorus, tyrant of Cassandrea, the
ancient Potidaea, likewise notorious for his cruelty, was put to death after
the taking of Cassandrea hy Antigonus 1.—p0enas sustullt, the more
unused expression, but used by Cicero also in Cat. 11, 13, 28 (poenam sni
sceleris sufferat) and Pro Font. c. 17, 39 (victoriae poenas suffinae). Cf.
Nonius, p. 396.

163. 4. Anaxarchus of Abdera had once deeply offended the Cyprian
tyrant Nicocreon in the presence of Alexander the Great; afterwards, when
Nicocreon had him in his power, he put him to death.

163. 6. Zenonem of Elea (Velia). Cicero says of him in Tusc. 11,
22: perpessio est onmia potius, quam conscias delendae tyrannidis indi·
caret. The tyrant’s name was Nearchus.

163. 9. Harpalum. The allusion is apparently to the notorious pirate&
called by other authors Skirtalos or Skirpalos, into whose hands Diogenes
himself had once fallen.

163. 17. oum ad Peloponnesum classem appulisset. This is
evidently an error; nothing is known of an expedition of Dionysius to the
Poloponnesus. The occasion of the error was the surname Olympii, which

Cicero referred to Olympia in Elis. But there were temples of the Olym·
pian Jupiter in many other places, even in Syracuse where this story is
located by Aelian. V. H, Ι, 20.

163. 23. Epidauri. This is also an error, occasioned hythe fact that
the Epidaurian temple of Aesculapius was the most noted. Valet. Max. Ι,
1, 3, who agrees with Cicero, is no authority, as he only drew his informa·
tion from Cicero. According to Athenaeus XV, 693 Dionysius also robbed
the god of his tahle3 the two stories are about equally probable.

1⁶4. 4. [tn [tyrannicis] rogum ts ne reading oranter 11. Senos-{45
mann has et impunitus wgo,- and Miiller leaves the Mss. reading in typica
nialis rogum without attempting to amend, hut thinks that Baiter is perhaps
correct. The passage is hopelessly corrupt. The last emendation that we
have seen is that of Hofmeister, Hermes Xll, 516: Tyndaride in rogum.
Schoemann has the following note :] 01 impunitus rogo illatus est. The
sense is: as he was unpunished during¹ his life and his death was quite a 1
