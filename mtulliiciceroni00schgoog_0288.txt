is also stated by Pliny H. N. IX, 42, p. 635 ; Plut. De Solen. An. c. 30 ;
and several other writers. According to modern naturalists however the
thing is very doubtful. — pina of the Mss. after nrorsu must be strichen
out 3 morsu belongs to squillae.

118. 27. admirandum est, congressune &c Mirari and admirari 124
not only express a feeling of wonder, but include also the idea of nor under-
standing ,· and as this implies uncertainty, ignorance, both verbs may ralre
after thern an indirect question. [Comp. English “ Ι wonder whether'' dre.
admiratio in the next sentence is “matter for admiration, wonder or per·
plexity.’']

118. 32. anitum for anatum. See Lachmann on Lucret, p. 16.

118. 34. exclusi fotique is not a ὓστερον πρότερσν; lor rhe fovere
continues more or less after the excludere, as Cicero himself says below c.

52, 129.

119. 3. platalea. This name occurs nowhere else. Pliny H. N. X, 49
40, p. 700 calls the bird platea and says the same of it as Cicero does here.
Aristotle H. An. IX, 10 says of επελεκᾶς, that he throws up the muscles
which he swallowed alive with the shells closed ; and then as they are
dead and the shells are open he takes out the meat and leaves the shells.
It is the meat that Cicero here calls en quaesunt esculenta. -What Pliny
and Cicero tell of the robbing of the booty from other birds is told by
modern naturalists of a sort of mew, the Lestrr'r parasilica or Larus para·
silicus-Instead of lu quod ipsa invaderet the Mss. have id quod,
evidently an error, because the relative sentence does not serve at all to
detine the preceding captum. Comp. Schoem. Opusc. Ac. 111, 337.

119. 9. Ranae marinae. The animal here rneanr is called by Pliny
H. N. IX, 42 rana piscatrix, diesi( in Plut. d. Sollert. An. c. 27, and
Antig. Hist. Mir, p. 74 West. lt is not properly a frog, but a lish which
has some resemblance to a frog, now called Lonclzus piscatorias. It has
on the head a pair of thread-like prolongatioris with the ends rounded
which it makes use of as a sort of bait. Comp. Oppian. Halieut. 11, 86.
[Moverr' is used in the middle sense]

119. 13. Illud . . . animadversum, “the fact observedby Aristotle.'’
—a quo pleraque sc. animadversa sunt. But this observation is not
found in the extant works of 'Aristotle

119. 19. ea adiuvatur, namely, when they ily with the wind
blowing from behindr whereas the preceding air . . . adversus pellitur
refers to a flight against the wind, when the triangular form of the flock
helps the flight. Comp. Plut. ibid. c. ro.-What is said oi tne onos 'xxx
the rear laying their heads and necks upon those in tramis gesaeh. X*
