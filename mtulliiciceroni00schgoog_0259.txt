246 nores.

whereas before tactus denoted the sense of touch itself. Comp. De Diu.
11, 46, 97: ex quo intellegitur plus terrarum situs quam lunae tactus (the
effectos the moon) ed irascendum valere. Comp. De Or. 11, 14, oo.

90. 28. Oceanique alatm umoribus. Comp. c. 33, 83 and 46, 118.
Diog. L.V11, 145: τρέφεσθαι δὲ . , , τὸν μὲν ἡλνον ἐκ τῆς μεγάἏης θαλάττης,
νοερὸν ὄντα ἁναμμα, τὴν δὲ σελήνην ἐκ ποτίμων ὑδάτων, ἀερομιγῆ τυγχάνουσαν
καῖ πρόσγειον οὖσαν. Comp. Ideler on Arist. Meteor. ΙΙ, 2, 6.- [possetis
an emendation of hl'dller. Schoemann reads] possit=dbvoeff dv, modus
potent. The protasis is contained in sine pastu: nisi pascatur.

41 90. 32. confector consumptorque. The second word serves to
desine the first, which of itself alone might be ambiguous. Conseetrix
rerum onimium vetustas is cited from Cicero by Lactantius VII, 11, 5.

90. 34. llle corporeus, ie. quiesi in corporibus; although in other
places the word rather means “carperent’' corpere praeditus, as also in
Cicero limae. c. 4 and 8. On the other hand in De Fin. ΙΙΙ, 14, 45 res
corporeae are bodily endowinerrts, as health, beauty dre—It is hardly
necessary to remark that ignis corporeus here is quite the same with hic
noster calor above ξ 30, the heat which gives life and growth to all earthly
creatures. This comes from the ardor caelestis, the ether of the highest
regions, where it is pure and unmixed with grosser matter. Cicero uses
ardor for the Greek αὶάηρ (from αῐθω) ; and Balbus below c. 36, 91 thinks
it necessary to make a sort of excuse for employing it as being less current
in Latin. ¹

9¹· 5. et quidem, here equivalent to et profectas· an addition with
emphasis.

42 91. 8. Aristoteli ridetur. No such remark is to be found in the
extant writings of eiristotle3 but the Ps. Plutarch (Plac. Phil. V, 20) says:
ἐστι πραγματεία Ἀριστοτέλους, ἑν princepe γένη ζώων φησί, χερσαῖα, ἔνυδρα,
πτηνά, οὐράνια, Besides comp. note 1, 13, 333 and Bernays, p. 102.

9¹· 13. in ils sensum inesse dc. It would have been more correct,
and more adapted to the purpose of the argument, had Cicero written: in
iis sensum acerrimum inesse el intellegentiam celerrimam.

16 91.15. Etenim lloet videre. Etenim introduces not a reason for
the proposition immediately preceding, which, as following from undis·
puted premises‚ needed no further reason, but rather a reason in addition
to those already brought forwerd; it is therefore a new link in the chain
of remoning, and would have been introduced quite as well at least by
porro or praeterea. Cicero often uses elenz'en and eninr in this way.
Comp. Madvig De Fin. Ι, 1, 3. The warrant for this usage is to be found
in the real meaning of enim, which originally was not causative but only
asseverative.
