32· 4. ad agnitionem animi. Through knowledge oi God the}
mind gains more knowledge of itself, inasmuch as it participales in the
divine essence; knowledge of God and knowledge of one's seli are cor·
relative. Comp. Tusc. V, 25, 70: Ut ipsa se meus agnoscat xconiunctamque
eum diviua mente se sentiat-De Legg. 1, 8, 25: ut is agnoscat deum,
qui uude ortus sit quasi recordetur ac noscat. Hence too the study ol this
subject is adagnitionem animi pulcherrima, because it leads to a worthy
and admirable result in a knowledge of one's seli.

ad moderandam religionem, because only a right understanding of
the divine nature can give the proper balance and direction to our wor-
ship. Compare below II, 61, 153.

32. 5. nequa. The relative refers not to religionem, but to the more

is unexplained and the resulting desire to understand it, is ἀρχὴ φιλοσοφίας.
[Justin Martyr, Cohort. ad Graecos, c. 5: Ei δὲ καὶ τούτους (Platonem et
Aristotelem) μὴ σνμφωνονντας ἀλλήλοις εὕροιμεν, ῥᾴδιον οἶμαι roal τὴν τούτων
ἄγνοιαν γινώσκειν σαφῶς] -Instead oi debeat debeant would be better3
or else id should be inserted aster ut.-In some Mss. the copula beforev
principium is wanting, others have id est instead, and many critics have
considered principium itself as a spurious addition. [The text here is
hopelessly corrupt, and none of the proposed emendations give a satis·
iactory sense. It is true that men set out from ignorance to think or
philosophize on any subject whatever, but, as Aristotle and Plato say, it is
the desire to escape from that ignorance and to attain knowledge that
