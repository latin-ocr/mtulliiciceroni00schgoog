about impressions which flow to us from the gods; and these im·
pressions‚ they say, received not by the senses, but by the mind,
give rise in it to the conception of a happy aud immortal being
(103-105). Impressions of this sort however, which are simply
creatures of the imagination, are more properly called dreams and
fancies, and the whole theory is idle talk (106-108). If the immor· ¹
tality of the gods is to be deduced from the law of isonomy‚ we have
just as good a right to conclude that there must be immortal men,
because there are mortal men, and men living in the water, because
there are rnen living on land.¹ Finally it remains unexplained, how
these impressions can arise from the atoms‚ and the immortal gods
in this way therefore are completely inexplicable (109, tro). The case
is just as bad in regard to the happiness of the gods For this can·
not exist without virtue, and virtue without action is inconceivable.
lf with the Epicureans we place happiness in sensual enjoyment, this
is itself inconceivable in the case of such gods (ιιι, 112). There
remain then only freedom from pain and the consciousness of eter-
' nal, never-ending comfort. But this is beset with difficulties3 for
we cannot understand how with the continual stream of atoms flow-
ing in upon them, and taking form again flowing forth from thern,
the gods can have any certainty of never being annihilated. So
then the Epicurean god is no more happy than he is immortal.
When Epicurus speaks of piety and reverence for the gods, those
are only phrases with no basis of truth3 for nobody cau feel rever·
enee for such gods as his (113-116). And when he boasts of freeing
men from superstition, that is all very easy if at the same time you
substantially abolish the belief in the gods; the same boast may be
made by those who deny the existence of any gods (117-119).
Democritus too, from whom Epicurus borrowed the greater part of
his doctrine, gives no satisfactory teaching about the gods, although
he allows thern at least to exercise a benevolent or a harmful influ-
ence on men, but Epicurus annihilates all religion out and out, and
Posidonius is quite right in saying that Epicurus really did not

l Epicurus might answer here, that the idea oi ‘¹ man'' is one derived only
from our experience, and as such necessarily excludes the attribute of immor·
' tality and of life in the water. Beings that might be immortal, or live in the
water, even if they resembled men, could not for this reason be included under
the term '¹ man’'
