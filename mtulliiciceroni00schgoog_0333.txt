294 NOTES.

140. 10. lu Salaria, scil. via. This was the name of the road leading
from Rome into the Sabine country to Reate, quia per eam Sabini sal a
mari (ie. from the salt works near Ostia) deserebant. Fest. Paul., p. 327
Muli-The city gate corresponding was anciently called Salaria, after·
wards porta Collina. Festus, p. 326.—neseio qu1d3 a depreciatory
expression.

140. 12. homines homine natos. According to the poetic myth·
ology both had a mortal mother, Leda, one, Castor, had also a mortal
father, Tyndarus, while Pollux was ason of Jupiter.

140. 13. Homerus . . . reeens ab illorum aetate. The Tyndari·
dae were, as brothers of Helen and Clytemnestra, contemporaries of the
Greeks who fought before Troy, although they died before the war in the
flower of youth. Homer was thought by many, as by Krates and his fol·
lowers, to have lived immediately after the Trojan war; see Procl. Chres-
tom. in Becker’s edition of the Scholia to the Iliad, p. 1. But Cicero in
another passage (De Republ. II, 10, 18) cites the opposite opinion of
σώετε, according to which Homer lived about thirty years before the Spar-
tan Lycurgus, whom he places a hundred and eight years before ὡς first
Olympiad, i.e. 885 ; and in Tuscul. V, 3, 7 he makes Homer and Lycurgus
contemporaries. The reason of his attributing the other view to Cotta is
easily seen. The passage of Homer alluded to is 11. ΙΙΙ, 243.

140.14. cantheriis albis. Balbus in ΙΙ, 2,6 said cum equis albis.
The expression here substituted is derisive 3 for cantherius or canterius,
properly gelding, is also used, like caballus, of common pack·horses. So
the following nullis calonibus, “without grooms.'’

140. 16. M.cat0n1, the old Censorius.

12 14o.19. quod probari potest, i.e. what at least may pass for prob-
able. We know moreover that the Academics recognized in general uo
certainty but only probability. See Introd, p. 13.

140. 21. divinos esse et aeternos. See note on 1, 15, 39.

13 140. 25. (ab) A. Postumio aedem . ..dedleatam The temple
was vowed by the dictator A. Postumius at the battle 0f Lake Regillus;
it was dedicated at a later time by his son. So says Livy ΙΙ, 20, 12 and
42, 5, although he says nothing of any apparition in the battle.

140. ²7· Graecorum . . . proverbium. Suidas: ἀληθέστερα τῶν ἐπὶ
Σάγρᾳ· παροιμία ἐπὶ τῶν ἀληθῶν μέν, οὑ πιστευομένων δέ. Tite proverb also
occurred in Menander. See Meineke on his fragments, p. 17. For ffle
battle on the Sagra see note on II, 2, 6.

19 140. 31. After the apparitions oi the gods bainus (ΙΙ, 3, γ) had cited
divination asa proof of the existence oi the gods. “tue cummeneementoi
