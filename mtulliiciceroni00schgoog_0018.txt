that Pythagoras paid a pious reverence to the popular gods¹; and
none of the older philosophers seems to have been accused ol the
contrary. lt is true that Socrates was reproached by his accusers
with denying the gods of the people and introducing new ones3 but
this reproach was in fact rather a deduction drawn by themselves
from certain utterances ol Socrates than one which he had deserved
by his actual opinions. We know on the contrary by the most
credible evidence² that he by no means withdrew from the tradi-
tional worship of the gods, and hence did not deny their existence3
although he imagined them as different from the common concep-
tion, and thought it most adr-isable not to touch upon the mytho-
logical fables unless occasion required.³ Nor did the pupils of Soc-
rates find it necessary to deny the existence of the popular deities,
although Plato held that there was a higher god above them whose
crentures and servants they were: and we do not find that he was
attacked for despising the popular religion. His opinion oi the my·
thologital hables may be sufficiently gathered horn the lact that he
banishes horn his ideal state the poets who originated and circulated
them: although heis not at all opposed in itself to a mythological form
of discourse upon diiine things: indeed he often makes uscos it to
express figuratively what he (annot express literally. Antisthenes
too assumed, like Plato. only one supreme deity, but did not hesi-
tate to make the multitude of popular deities subordinate to him.
He regarded the mpthological iables, at least in part, as allegories:
and expressed in the severest manner his disapproval oi the concep
tions of the gods which corresponded to the literal sense of the
sables.⁴ Aristotle took the same course⁵: and what we read oi his
disciples, as for example Heraclides of Pontus or Theophrastus (Cic.
Nat Deor. 1, 13, 34. 35), shows only riews which, though foreign to
the popular religion, are still not irreconcilable with it. No more
did Strato come into collision with the popular faith in accepting,
